0,"I'm not suicidal and wouldn't take my own life, but sometimes, I've wished for an accident to occur and take it. I feel like I just shouldn't be here and wish I wouldn't have been born so I didn't have to go through life. For me, it's a chore, but I don't know if that's normal or a sign of something.","Sounds like a sign of great unhappiness, or sadness, or insecurity.The real way you'll find out what this feeling is about is to ask yourself your own question.  Inside you are the only one who will feel when you discover the true answer to your question.Everyone feels some amount of discontent in their lives once in a while. Its normal to not feel entirely happy all the time.Try to accept your unhappiness as motivation to learn more about who you are, what you like, whom you like.Study yourself bc this way you increase the chance to find a road which feels right and happy."," Hello. Adults who come from abusive home histories (physical, emotional, or even psychological), may take a long time to heal from that abuse. We carry our past with us everywhere we go, and it is up to us to find resolutions to past hurts. This is often easier said than done, but it is possible. From the perspective of those with whom you have shared your concerns, it might be assumed that based on where you are in life and who you are now, that you have already worked through any issues from your younger years. Some of our deepest scars in life are indeed invisible and suppressed. We have to get to the place where we can take care of the inner child that is still hurting, by recognizing that those who hurt us - however they did, might have had their own challenges which prevented them from functioning and behaving in ways we might have deeply needed. Those who have directly hurt you, may not be capable of acknowledging and understanding how you were affected by their actions - even in the worst of cases. They themselves may be doing what they can, either out of shame or heartbreak for their own actions, to work on forgetting how they behaved toward you all those years before. How are they behaving toward you now? Can you find it in your heart to forgive those who have hurt you? Forgiveness is the gift we give ourselves, and isn't dependent on an apology from an offender. By forgiving (even in the absence of any apology), we are releasing the weight of the burden we are carrying that reflects the offense we feel was committed against us. Sometimes therapy can be helpful in this process. Talking with someone who can be non-judgmental and reflects an empathetic position toward you might be what you need right now. Seeking out a therapist to help you work through these negatives feelings and thoughts is much easier, than trying to go it alone. I would encourage you to reach out and find someone who resonates with you on that journey, so that you can begin a path toward healing.Warm regards,Shawn Berthel, M.S., LMH"
1,My girlfriend just quit drinking and she became really depressed. She told me that she wants to move. What can I do to help her? I want her to stay.,"You're probably not going to like my answer.Your question says a lot about what YOU want rather than what she wants or what may be best for her. Sometimes, what's best for a person is the hardest thing to do, and may be completely opposite of what YOU want.Addictions don't happen in a vacuum. If you've had any experience with addicts at all, then I'm sure you've heard the term ""enabler"". A lot of the times, when people think they're ""helping"", they're actually enabling the addict to continue their self-destructive behavior. Tough love and clear boundaries are needed in a lot of situations, but especially with addictions. Family and friends are often the biggest contributing factor to someone choosing to use/drink, continuing to do so, or relapsing back into it.You said she recently quit. You said she is depressed. She wants to move. When a person receives counseling for addictions, they are encouraged to make changes like this. They need to break the habit, and this means removing people from their lives at times. It means moving to new locations. Anything that may trigger a relapse needs to be identified and removed. Not only that, but the addict needs to do a lot of personal reflection to figure out WHY they use/drink in the first place, and not only break the physical addiction to it, but deal with whatever is the root cause that led them to use in the first place. She may need some time alone to figure out who she is as a person, time to make some decisions for herself and do what she needs to do to be healthy.Don't pressure her to stay. Let her have the freedom to do what she needs to do. If she stays, the decision needs to be hers and hers alone. It doesn't need to be made under pressure. That will only lead to resentment. Support her, but don't try to change her or make her do anything, especially for selfish reasons. Let her go. It sounds like she needs some time to focus on herself right now. It wouldn't be a bad idea for you to do the same.", It is a good thing that you have recognized that you had good intentions to reach out to her and she has done her part to help you. Congratulations!I'm glad that you are reaching out. I think that in time you will have a conversation with your girlfriend about your sincere interest in her.I'd also encourage you to keep a watch over your relationship so that you can see for yourself if you are becoming irritated by what you see. It is actually quite common for two people to want to discuss their arguments and it can make you wonder about your own patience with the relationship
2,My girlfriend just quit drinking and she became really depressed. She told me that she wants to move. What can I do to help her? I want her to stay.,"I would say talk to her about her depression. The best thing you can do is let her know that you are there for her as a support system. I would encourage her to talk more if it helps and encourage her to get move involved in doing activities she likes to do. Also, getting connected in a community of people is important to help with feeling depressed. Encourage her to speak with a therapist or counselor to address her depression as she has made a major change in her life by deciding to stop drinking. She may believe moving is the best to help with this. You can share with her that you want her to stay and express to her how you feel. Ultimately, you will have to respect her boundaries and the decision she chooses to make. She may want to move and this may be what she feels is best for her life. If she does choose to move that will be her decision. It sounds like she is trying to do what is going to make her happy. Maybe staying in the city she is currently in is causing her more feelings of sadness."," This is so very common in this crazy situation.  I would suggest doing some self-care activities such as going to olan therapy and members will often provide you with resources and ideas to help you navigate the process of ending a relationship.  Remember that when an individual is going through a painful and confusing time in their life, there are many things they can do to help themselves through this time.  It is important to remember that any relationship that is meant to last for both the person who wants to finish it and the relationship that he or she has worked so hard to have this relationship.  There are many options for an individual to help themselves through this time, if that is something.  I hope this was helpful.  AN"
3,My girlfriend just quit drinking and she became really depressed. She told me that she wants to move. What can I do to help her? I want her to stay.,"People often have very different values and opinions when they are drinking excessively and when they stop drinking so much.Did the two of you share drinking as an activity?  If yes, then did you stop drinking too?Often when partners meet each other as drinking buddies when one gets sober, the relationship ends.  Once the terms of any relationship changes, one possibility is that it dissolves.The best way to go is to start the conversation of what you genuinely want.  This is the only way she'll really know your thoughts.Ask her to give serious consideration and discussion over at least a few weeks or months, to moving away from you.  This is a fair request since you are in a relationship.If she's changed so much by giving up drinking, which is possible, that she no longer wants to be in relationship to you, then you are better off being without a drinking gf, even if the truth she delivers is a hurtful one."," You're in a tough spot.You're doing the right move for her.I'm not sure whether you're just giving her the money or spending your hard earned time on behalf of the relationship.I can't say with certainty that the relationship will never come to an end, but if she is open to the relationship, maybe will be a good ending to the relationship.Stress management is a very important issue for both of you.  Having a conversation with her about it might open up a lot of new thought about the couple's relationship.Good luck"
4,My girlfriend just quit drinking and she became really depressed. She told me that she wants to move. What can I do to help her? I want her to stay.,"After stopping the abuse of alcohol, depressive symptoms are common. She may benefit from exploring why she wants to move and see if she would still want to move if she did not feel depressed. 12 step meetings can also be helpful."," You're in a tough spot.There's no way to keep a relationship while simultaneously feeling overwhelmed by grief and uncertainty. I'm glad you've decided to end the relationship. It's a good thing to finally address your question, because the way that you're feeling may be helping her to better cope with the disappointment. Do you think she's ready to move on? Do you think she wants to be with you? I bet this is going to be difficult. Do you think she's ready to move on? I mean, this is the person. Do you feel like you can be content and happy with this person for a while longer? The unhealthy way of handling relationships involves overreacting to each other, especially when there is little or no personal benefit to the relationship. That said, you're right to be concerned about how she handles herself. In time, she will allow you to express how she feels, and how she feels about you, in the privacy of her own mind. It's ready and pay ready. As much as you want to live with this person, they're not going to be able to make it work. Ask yourself: ""What is the right way to handle conflict?"" or ""What are the things I would prefer that I don't mess around with?"" The answer matters. The first thing to do is to reflect on what you're feeling in your life and to ask yourself, if it's true, and to ask them again when they come back together. Ask them to do this in a non-threatening way and ask them to be clear in their answers. If they say no, then a question that may be of some assistance is to ask them what they're thinking and what they say if they get a similar response. If it's not a yes, then maybe you can use that as an example and then talk about the unpleasant parts of relationships. If it's a no, then some more specific questions might be: ""What is the right way to talk with my girlfriend?"" ""What are the things I would prefer that I don't mess around with?"" ""What are the things that I would like her to know about me?"" Basically, the more specific questions would be: ""What is the right way to talk with me?"" ""What are the things that I would like her to know about me?"" Then more specific questions would be: ""What are the things that I would like her to know about me?"" and ""What are the things that I would like her to know about me?"" Basically, all that's left is speculation.Warning, something wasn't quite right with this guy. I'll admit, I had the same question: ""What are the things I would like her to know about me?"" I don't know if that's what he is referring to or if he is just being weird. If there are things that you want her to know, that's all you can do. She doesn't have to know everything that she has to know about you. Ask her for advice and tell her how you feel. If she wants to know more, that's her turn. If she doesn't want to know everything that you have to know, then it is her choice to not know about you. This is a choice you have to make, and not your parent's fault. Try to do your best to not explode if she does. I hope that's helpful. Be well.Robin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPC, NC"
5,My girlfriend just quit drinking and she became really depressed. She told me that she wants to move. What can I do to help her? I want her to stay.,"You should start by speaking with her about what has her so down. Have their been some significant events in her life that have affected her? Have their been significant events in your relationship that can be affecting  you both? If she just stopped drinking, she may be struggling to finding an alternative and healthier behavior. This is something the two of you can explore together. Also, if need be perhaps she can speak to a therapist to discuss her feelings about quitting alcohol. It sounds like you really care and right now she could use all the support she can get despite her pushing you away."," This is so very common in this crazy situation.  I would suggest doing some self-care.  Movement can be done with lots of help.  Know that you need to be there for her and help her heal.  You can also contact the coupleress and make a list of things you want to discuss.  There are many ways of coping with sadness that one can do.  You could let her know what is bothering her.  Then, mention to her the emotion you are sensing and try to be as gentle and patient as you can.  You can also ask if she would be willing to make some suggestions for taking some time off from drinking.  Hopefully she will be a good sounding board"
6,"My life is completely normal, yet I feel empty inside. I feel as if I already know why I'm alive: to reproduce and die.","Are there any times or moments in which you feel other than ""empty""?  Start with knowing the context of when you feel something other than empty.If there is no recent example, then in your mind, go back in time to think of when you felt something other than empty.  Recall what you liked about this time, whether you were by yourself or with others, what type of activity you were involved at the time of non-emptiness.How did you come to your conclusion that your life purpose is to reproduce and die?  If this is what your parents, siblings and extended family believe, it is possible that you have a broader view of yourself and haven't yet uncovered a way of defining your own philosophy of living.Give yourself the time to browse around online, or in person social meet ups, on your interests.  It is possible you will discover entire new areas of life and ways of considering life, that are brand new to you and which connect to your true self.This is one way of respecting your individuality, which of itself, may decrease your sense of emptiness."," This is not totally unusual behavior, but the fact that you ask this question and not the response you are getting suggests to you that this may be a problem for you. You are not alone.  It's also not uncommon for situations to go wrong when you try to talk about yourself"
7,"I am in high school and have been facing anxiety issues lately. Whenever I get close to being in a relationship, some kind of anxiety takes over and keeps me from the relationship. This anxiety causes me depression at times and even makes me want to vomit. While a semi-relationship should be joyous, for me, it’s an emotional nightmare I can’t get to the bottom of. I’ve had this before and had to leave the semi-relationship to avoid throwing up every time I made contact with my crush. What could be the reason behind this? Is it massive nerve problems? Is it a fear of a bad relationship?
   While I’m not quite ready to be in one anyway, I want to get to the bottom of this for a brighter future in which I can be in one. I don’t take medications and have no desire to, I have read forums, and I’ve talked about the issue with my sister who has faced similar problems.","Hi Helena,I felt a bit sad when I read this. This is a new term for me... ""semi-relationship"". What does it mean? I know that today's culture for young people is more of a ""hook-up"" culture than a dating one. Maybe that means that you develop connections to people but you keep yourself from hoping for a full relationship because no one is doing that anymore. That makes me feel sad. I hear a lot of young women (I'm not sure you're female, but that's my guess) say that they struggle with hook-ups because they can't let themselves hope for a phone call after a hook-up. Research tells us that, after a hook-up, college age women tend to feel used and unworthy, and men tend to feel guilty. I think this scenario works better for men than women, but many of both genders are left unsatisfied in the end.This is only one possible explanation for your anxiety...that your gut knows that it wants to feel fully coupled with someone but you struggle with whether it's okay to want or expect that.Maybe take a moment and listen to anxiety. Anxiety tends to try to convince us that something's wrong with us or something bad's going to happen. Anxiety sometimes prefers to stay vague (it's more difficult to refute it then), but you can try to clarify it's whisperings by asking yourself these questions: What am I afraid of? What is the worst thing that might happen here? Then what might happen, and what would be the worst part of that? Keep going until you find the very worst thing that might happen? Might someone not want you...might you feel rejected...or feel not good enough...you might get hurt?Then when you find that core fear, you can look at your life and I bet you'd find a place where that idea or fear originated. A big moment (or many smaller ones) when you actually DID feel or get rejected or abandoned or hurt. In the end, it's a feeling you're trying to avoid (not life or relationship), and anxiety is trying to help you avoid it by making you overcautious. But this doesn't work for you! Good! With the help of a qualified therapist, you can learn to talk back to anxiety and move forward in life and love with calm. confidence."," I’m sorry to hear about that. I have a rule to follow regarding my sister's feelings regarding that she is not taking any. I think it is always my turn to explain to her the rules. She has to respect the rules. She has to think through the ramifications and just see the possibility of what her sister can do. I’m curious about her reaction. As a parent I always tell my kids that, no matter what your daughter does, she has to respect the rules. It’s all fun and games. If your daughter doesn’t like any of it, she can. If she doesn’t like anything she can play, she can get into that tight circle and then the circle will naturally grow smaller. The circle on which the circle for a boy usually starts will always start in a circle that is not for boys. If your daughter does not like play or any of the activities that result in the circle, she can. The play question is whether she likes you or not. If you like her as much as you like her, the question becomes, how much of an effort is she willing to make in return? Scary things. If she loves you and you don't know how much of an effort you're willing to give, then check out her website.com/mom or herPinterest.com. Both of these websites have great information about mom and how to show her love. Compare it to a tornado. The storm has passed, but it is still up to her to see if she feels the need to stay in the tornado. She may need to stay in the tornado, but not in the pain. Not every woman can feel the need to stay in a tornado. If she is in the tornado, she may need to rest or go to a hospital. If she is in the hospital, she may need to go to a trauma center to get her/himself stabilized. They won’t care if she is okay anymore. I hope this helps. Be well.Robin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPC, NC"
8,"I've been hospitalized twice. Once was last month for psychiatric help. I'm on medicine, but I'm struggling with fighting the negative thoughts, irrational fears, and loneliness. The people around me aren't helping much.","If you are someone who usually has a job, pays or contributes to household bills, and generally manages your own daily life, then here are some suggestions.Start with small changes in your life so that you will feel successful in developing little areas of personal happiness.Since the people whom you currently are in your life ""aren't helping much"", consider branching out your life so that you are with those with whom you do feel help you.Follow your natural interests.  If you like reading, look online for a local book club.   If you like watching birds, look up a bird watching group.Social isolation increases the intensity of negative feelings.Also, the way healthcare is set up in the US, psychiatrists spend 15 minutes asking a person questions and then giving them a pill script.    There is almost no human interest in the person.If you'd like feeling better as a person, then find people.   Relying only on our mental health system will keep you feeling low and unsteady.If your life is a little more sheltered and you are in a group home setting or your basic needs are taken care of by someone or some organization, then similar advice is still valid.Find and participate in whatever human settings which appeal to you and are available on a somewhat regular basis."," My heart goes out to you.  In constant fear of judgment or punishment, people take these ""services"" very literally and become ""parrots"" (supposedly unwanted) when in fact they are being helped and supported by powerful people (judge and jail).You are in a vulnerable position; as long as you resist being put into a vulnerable position, and you also resist being led to it, the people around you will believe what they hear you feel anyway.In general, the ""parrots"" are our age group; however, depending on where you live, people may not believe you in the same way about yourself.So if you are really struggling with their help, ask them to repeat this request for you to repeat for them"

They're really nice to me, but I'm too scared of change. I really want to work up the courage to lose my fear.","Change can be uncomfortable, but sometimes those uncomfortable moments are the opportunity for us to be the person we feel we really are.  It sounds like you like to spend the time in your head anticipating the worst, why not be in the present and encourage yourself that you can talk to people and it will be okay.  By telling yourself it will not be okay, or that it will go wrong you are hurting your confidence to do what you want.  Give yourself some credit for being awesome and tell yourself you can build new friendships...it may be the motivation you need to move past this fear."," Social Anxiety is a very complex issue. Often, it is the result of unhappy childhood memories, absentmindedness, traumatic experiences, and/or drug or alcohol abuse. In working with a competent therapist, you may be able to get more insight into the roots of your anxiety, what it is trying to convey to you in ways that are uncomfortable, and perhaps not helpful for you in the long run"
10,I was violently raped by another women who was my friend of 13 years. I’m having bad flashbacks. I’m scared to sleep because I see it in my dreams. I don't leave the house because I have panic attacks.,"I'm sorry for your suffering.There are therapy programs which help people to gradually feel more at ease so that daily living does not feel so frightening.Once you feel stronger and more secure from such a behavioral program, you'll be able to sleep more peacefully and leave the house whenever necessary to do your regular life.Then, you will be able to open and clear the deep emotional hurt that always occurs from being violated by a trusted friend.Sending good wishes in your work!"," It is completely understandable that you would not like the sight of your intimate partners.   Possibly because you are scared of being victimized again, you will consider other ways of protecting yourself from the other partner.What is important, however, is that you feel you are being taken advantage of.  It is not possible to compensate and give away your intimate partner for your fear.As much as possible, make sure you are taking good care of yourself.  If at any time this person is sneaking out or being sneaky, it is important to get medical help so you can live a healthy and happy life with your current relationship"

14,"We live with my ex-partner’s sister and her husband. We have been there for five years now. They are Hispanic and talk to my daughter in their language. Sometimes they overstep their balance between aunt and uncle and reach into my role as a parent. They neglect to see this. I do, and it reflects in my child's behavior. She sees them as stable but is upset that her dad isn't here, and my intuition tells me she blames me to a degree because she doesn't know about his alcohol addictions.","Hi New York, I'm happy to hear that your daughter doesn't know about her dad's addictions. Although you don't say how old she is, and I imagine that at some point in her life she will be ready to know the truth, I trust your instinct that now is not the time. Your ability to have clear boundaries about what is adult conversation and what is suitable for a child to know are really important here, and I can tell you're being appropriately protective and a thoughtful parent. As much as this helps your daughter, I sense that you also know you can't take away the emotional pain that comes from having an absent parent. Children tend to blame themselves for a parent's absence. These children need extra love and support wherever they can get it.You say that you feel like there is a wedge between you and your daughter. I understand that having your ex partner's relatives in the same home would make it uncomfortable at times. It is very important to establish boundaries; only you should parent your daughter, but it's also natural for people to want to assist you. Let's trust that their intentions are good, if there is no evidence to the contrary. As much as they support you, they also  have emotional ties to your daughter's father. While there is potential for discomfort in this complex situation, there are also many positive factors here that I invite you to see.I don't know what your culture is, but for your daughter to have the opportunity to preserve her father's heritage language and a relationship with his family are potentially wonderful additions to her life. In general, the more adults around loving and supporting a child, the better. It could be that you are feeling threatened by small moments where there appears to be a special connection between your daughter and her father's family. Nothing anyone else does can take your daughter's love from you. My hope for you is that you can feel so secure in your own position as loving mother that you will not feel intimidated by other positive connections your daughter has.

15,"My mother-in-law is mentally ill. She has been for most of her life. She cuts herself. She has been in and out of psychiatric hospitals for about 40 years. She has voices in her head that tell her to cut herself. She has had multiple shock therapy treatments, and she’s on enough medication to take down an elephant. Her parental rights for her two children were taken away from her when my husband was a boy—he is now in his late 30s. She doesn’t even have custody of herself. She hasn’t asked yet, but she has been insinuating that she wants to babysit my child. How do I go about saying no without creating an issue?","Hi Fontana,Thanks for providing all the details needed in order to respond to your question. It seems very clear to me that ""no"" would be the appropriate response. I like your healthy boundaries, and I'll help you explore possible ways to respond to her. First, she hasn't asked yet, and you don't know that she will. Right now, you can pleasantly ignore her hints. They're not hurting you and if you ignore them, they're more likely to go away. You can address and reduce your own anxiety about the possibility of her asking by reassuring yourself that you have the right as parents to make this decision, and that if she's offended, that doesn't mean that you're being mean; it means that she has unrealistic expectations. So, the first goal is to put it out of your mind as a worry. You might never have to face that moment. But, I understand that you want to be prepared.As her son, perhaps your husband is the best one to answer the question, should it ever come. Is he willing to do this? But if you are comfortable, and if you're the one she asks, you can confidently give her a simple, honest response about why it won't happen. And I would suggest presenting a firmly closed door, rather than saying ""but maybe later"". No need to apologize or hum and haw...""We love that you want to be around Junior, and we definitely want you in his/her life. (try to leave out the ""but"" here). You're not in a healthy place, and we're not comfortable with you caring for him/her on your own.""If she pushes the issue, this is evidence of her denial or inappropriate boundaries. I'd let her know that it's not negotiable, that you understand if she's disappointed, but you're not open to discussing the issue. Really, there's nothing to discuss. Learning not to take responsibility for her emotions is part of having an ill person in your life. I wish you the best."," I'm sorry to hear about your situation.I'm not sure what to feel to get used to this. I get how your momma may be somewhat depressed, or if she has a depressive disorder. To answer your question, one could to very reasonably expect her to have some emotional or mental symptoms. I would suggest to   focus on your normal daily functioning. What do you notice when you wake up in the morning? Do you feel any different? Do you notice how your momma treats you?  Is her comment about your ability to make sense of difficult and confusing situations?  You may need to consider whether or not the family court agreement requires the court to consider your actual age.  If the court agreement states that either parent can be found not guilty, and the child is awarded reasonable attorney's fees, the child is generally considered a a a priori age to see a attorney.  In order to find out if the child's age is a problem, the court may order an evaluation and referral of the child's therapist. If the child's age is a problem, the appropriate action should be taken against the parent, if any violation occurs"
16,"For the last year, my adolescent son and daughter have been driving me nuts with fighting. I'm at my wits end. How can I get them to stop and get along?","That is a good question. Unfortunately there is no generic answer with this one. Kids fight for different reasons - wanting attention, wanting respect, feeling jealous, wanting space and to be left alone, or a whole bunch of other reasons. Regardless of the underlying motivations for fighting, most conflicts result from misunderstandings and assumptions about the motivations of others and one of the best ways to start figuring out what is going on is to sit them down and have some conversations with them. These conversations should be centred on getting a better understanding of why they are angry with each other and really understanding them. It is important that they each know that you are committed to understanding their experience rather than simply sitting them down and lecturing them about what they are doing wrong. The more they are able to understand each other and feel understood the more likely they will be cooperative and considerate of each other. One exercise for doing this that can be very helpful is ""active listening"" where one person speaks and the other person reflects back what they heard the other person say and then checks for understanding. This is hard to do but it often illuminates where the misunderstandings and assumptions are. If this doesn't work it may be time to get a family therapist or counsellor involved who can help facilitate dialogue and resolve conflict."," I sympathize with you! You can stop comparing your son to your son, and ask yourself why is that the case? Is it that your son feels more at home in your home?  Is he sadder in your house than in the abroad?  Do you feel that his father can bring him home to his family?  Do you feel that he can be at your side when you visit him in your travels?  Do you feel that he can be with you during your visits?  Do you feel that he can be of help during your visits?  Do you feel that he can be of support during your visits?  Do you feel that he can reassure you during your visits?  Do you feel that he can be defensive during your visits?  Do you feel that he can be supportive of you during your visits?  Do you feel that he can be rude during your visits?  I can't tell you how many times that I have to explain it to you, but I think you will realize how wrong I was.I know that it's not your son's fault in any way. In fact, you can't make someone love someone the way you're treating him. I believe most government agencies and friends would agree that a good relationship is essential for everyone. I think you're getting the point across, and that's all there is to it. The important thing to remember is that your son loves you and wants to be with you, and that you're the only woman in the whole home who is allowed to be manic and have sex with other people. This is no longer a question you're having with your husband, and the shame is that you thought of opening up? He (or she) will most likely never understand the whole picture, only realize that it's all very confusing and sometimes scary. Of course you don't want your husband to understand or relate to the feelings of your son. The way it goes is that her feelings are only her own feelings, and no one else's are involved in the parenting. The best thing you can do for her and that for you is to understand why she is so open to having a relationship with you. Why do you think she would want a relationship with you? Ask her. How do you know she would want a relationship with you? She might want to know the details, but maybe offer your mother understanding and love.  Maybe.  But it is never a good idea to try to make her feel like she has no right to be in a relationship with you. It is the most natural way of opening up a child to parents who are always in competition for her affection and care. The worst thing is to try to make her feel that she needs to be in a relationship with you. She needs change, and the best thing for her and your relationship is to make her feel that she needs to be healthy and happy with you. But it is never a good idea to try and make her feel like she has to be in a relationship with you. It is the most natural way of opening up a child to a parent who is always in competition for her affection and care"
17,"I'm a teenage girl, and I feel very bad about my weight. I don't know how to make it stop.","One way may be to take some sort of physical movement class in which you will be regarded by the teacher as one of the students, not the girl who weighs a certain amount.In a movement class such as pilates, yoga, aerobics, weights, dance, when the standard for clothing is somewhat fitted and shows more of our physical bodies than regular clothing, and to be considered as one of the students, not stigmatized for how much or how little you weigh, may help you be as accepting of yourself as the teacher is of you!"," It has been said that it is possible to become motivated to lose weight by consuming a balanced diet and exercising.  You said that you feel like you are ""aware"" of your eating habits. I agree with you about not being able to change your eating habits.  You said that you know you need to ""keep it different for a while.""  Could you tell me more about what that means to you? What are some things that make you feel good about eating a balanced diet and exercising?  I would recommend doing some ""anxieties"" about what you are doing and asking yourself ""What is my true motivation?""  That is knowing more about yourself.  Know yourself.  You can overcome those moments and thoughts and you will feel better"

That it's kind of pointless? It seems like you're trying to get more out of your life...getting over it. context: Hello. Being fat is not something that anyone is happy with just from being around people. It is something that many people are ashamed of and do not want to deal with. While there is nothing to shame you about, it is important to have forgiveness for what you have done to yourself. There is no way to be ""good enough"" for anyone. You did the right thing and you are already forgiven. If you want to live a healthy life, you will learn what is possible to live with if you learn to have compassion for yourself. You did the right thing and you are already doing so. If you are feeling like you want to focus on being happy instead of being fat, I would recommend seeing a nutritionist. They can help you change your eating habits and can help you change your lifestyle. I think you should see someone for support. You can't change your body, but you can change your mind. When you talk to your friends, it is good to admit that you try to change their behavior. It is normal to have those moments when you realize that you are completely in charge of what goes on in their lives. I think it is great that you want to help them and the more you try to hide your feelings, the more you will feel comfortable. It is normal to not be comfortable with someone telling you what to do. It is okay to not make the decisions that are important to you. If you are uncomfortable with your parents or your parents, that is okay. If you are comfortable with your parents but not comfortable with you, that's a different story. It can be uncomfortable having your parents advise you about important matters. It can be equally uncomfortable having your parents advise you about matters. It all depends on what you decide here. If you are comfortable telling your parents about what is going on, maybe they will trust you enough to not push you away. If they don't trust you, then it may be worth it to make a goal to get them to trust you again. It can be hard to tell your parents if you are doing things in denial because you know that they instinctively want to trust you. They might say, ""That's not what you're saying. I know that you want to make sure that things are going smoothly. I know that you want to know what your parents want to know."" ""I know that you feel sad and hurt when you don't feel accepted by your parents. But can you tell them what you know?"" It can be helpful to write down what you know about yourself so that you can ask them to be supportive of you in the future. I would also suggest asking whether your parents trust you and your decision to stay in the relationship is thoughtful and how they would like you to be doing since they are likely very supportive of you. If you are not supportive of your parents in their decision to stay involved, then you might want to look at someone like alexithymianlexibrand which can offer help with communication and problem-solving skills"

20,"A few nights ago I talked to this girl I know about my self esteem issues for the first time. We talked for hours and she told me time and again that I was a great guy. She told me I was attractive, and have a great personality, etc. I really started to feel better about myself by the time I woke up the next morning. Now, though, I can't stop thinking about her, but I leave to go back to college in a few days and I go to school 4 hours away from her. So now I feel constantly depressed because even if I told her how I felt it wouldn't matter. I feel helpless and I don't know what to do.","Hey!  It takes a lot of courage to share your feelings with someone!  And it sounds like you have been lucky to meet someone who makes you feel safe enough to explore some of your more painful feelings.  A big part of the process, however, of strengthening your self-concept is learning how to tell yourself those positive messages that you heard from your friend!  Leaving for college may also be contributing to your feelings of unsteadiness.  Try this - Make a list of all of the positive things that you know are true about yourself.  Ask your friends and family to contribute to the list.  Then carry it with you in your wallet - and when you need a self-esteem boost, take a look at it!  You are in a season of life that presents lots of challenges and opportunities.  Reach out to your long-distance friend when you need support - and take a walk over to the campus counseling center and check out what they might have to offer.  Be Wise!"," Hello. It sounds to me like you are having some very difficult times that you are not dealing with mental health issues. It sounds to me that you are feeling very helpless and isolated.

I don't know whether you are in or out of treatment. If you are both able to talk about the details of what you have been experiencing, you will eventually find a way to make changes.

21,I'm obsessing about a terrible breakup. Everything is a constant reminder. How do I move on?,"Moving on is the right question. Everyone's different in moving on. First, what can I learn about myself because of this painful time? Caring non-judgmental family and friends who listen with the head and heart help a iot. Other times I need a skillful, caring professional to help me move on. You will find a way because you've asked the right question. Dr. Spencer"," I think the best thing for you is to have some patience for the right person. If you're having a conversation with someone about an issue that's not really about you, then make it very clear that you're thinking about them with the hope that you'll learn more about their experience or will discover some insights or insights that would be helpful to you. As a general rule, the ""When you do X, I feel Y"" sentence goes far in helping others understanding.So, it's pretty much every single thing that happens in life, at some point in time, people. Yours and not you, the actual behavior, is what is defining the positive and negative behaviors"
22,I'm obsessing about a terrible breakup. Everything is a constant reminder. How do I move on?,The termination of a relationship can be a challenge to heal from. Having obsessions after a breakup are very normal and many of my clients experience them. It can help to create a distraction box and when the obsessions present themselves use your distraction activities. In the beginning try to distract from the obsessions for 5 minutes and work to increase that time over time. Celebrate your successes when you are able to distract yourself.," I think the best thing for you is to have some honesty in your thoughts and feelings. If you are feeling depressed or distressed, try to find a time when you are not thinking and write about the feelings. It will help to organize them so that you can talk about what is going on. As far as how to help, maybe try to be supportive to yourself, your family, and talking with a therapist. You can do this this this way, perhaps with the permission of your therapist"
23,I'm obsessing about a terrible breakup. Everything is a constant reminder. How do I move on?,"Initially, everything is a reminder because there is a trace of that other person present in everything in your life. When we lose someone, we're saying goodbye to what we thought our future was going to be.  Accepting that's changed and allowing ourselves to envision a new future is necessary to ""move on"". Start learning something new or try a new activity that you've always wanted to do.  Find whatever is ""good"" about being out of the relationship and focus on those things.  This can be an exciting time of transformation for you.   As time goes by, you'll add new things in your life that aren't entwined with this relationship and those things will begin to crowd out those things associated with the relationship.  Give yourself a little empathy, no one goes through a breakup without being sad.  It's ok to be sad.  It's even ok to feel devastated.  Loss of a relationship touches a primal need we have to belong.  It makes us feel insecure, unanchored.  In truth, we are ok, safe even.  This experience will open different perspectives for you.  There are lessons you'll take from it that will add another facet to you as a person.  Maybe in time, you'll even appreciate this experience.  I'm sorry you're hurting right now.  Best wishes to you, Allison"," Since you're so self-critical, are you spending time thinking about the breakup?The good news is that when you're reminded of the sadness of the breakup, you can also think about the joy of having done so the very moment you had the courage to tell your parents.It is my hope that you will find some loving ways to cope with the sadness of the breakup.  Communication is so important between you, and you being reminded of that bond will strengthen your ability to not lash out"
24,I'm obsessing about a terrible breakup. Everything is a constant reminder. How do I move on?,"Dealing with a breakup is difficult. We have high hopes and then those hopes and dreams are dashed and we feel at a loss for how to deal with this sudden change in our lives. First, it is important to acknowledge that losing a relationship is a loss and we need to grieve that loss. If we don't allow ourselves time to process and move through the grieving process, we may remain stuck and it may make it hard to move on. So in some ways, you don't want to move on too soon by just trying to ignore your feelings. Instead, take good care of yourself, talk to friends and give your self time to heal. The second most important thing is to forgive yourself; this is also an important part of taking care of yourself. You might be blaming yourself and re-living moments when you wish you would have done things differently. By replaying those thoughts you remain stuck. When we begin to forgive ourselves, we truly begin to heal. Lastly, in my experience the people who have the most difficulty moving on have not really severed all ties with their ex. They are still following them on social media or even checking in with texts. This is probably the hardest part for some people, but to move forward there needs to be a clear boundary and a clear ending. If you have a clear ending, you can have a new beginning. I hope this helps. Take good care of yourself!"," Since you're so self-critical, are you spending time thinking about the bad things that happened to you?This is a great place to start because what you'd like to do is to imagine what it would feel like whatever the actuality of what happened to you, to try to move forward whatever feelings you have.Think about what it would be like to feel whatever it is that you'd like to feel like you have.Feelings like sadness, anger, guilt and depression are normal. Of course you don't love yourself, but you're not alone.  It's often easier to snap your fingers and express yourself in any activity or with a friend (or family member) that way.Again, if you're struggling with ""normal feelings"" you probably have a lot to answer for in terms of how you actually are feeling.  Sometimes we put a lot of pressure on ourselves to do better than we actually are and this can sometimes put a lot of people off.  So my encouragement to you is this: keep looking at the world through a person's eyes, listening to your mom, and sometimes even doing things that give you comfort and make you feel better"
25,I'm obsessing about a terrible breakup. Everything is a constant reminder. How do I move on?,"Relationships can be extremely enjoyable and satisfying.  When relationships end, however, it can be devastating.  It is normal to go through a grieving process after a breakup.  Denial, bargaining, sadness, anger and eventually acceptance are all normal stages of grief.  You may experience these feelings all at once or one at a time.  Allow yourself time to grieve by expressing your emotions - talk to a friend or write in a journal.  Take care of yourself during this time by exercising, eating and sleeping well and spending time with friends.  After some time you should start feeling better.  If you feel like you're not feeling better and you don't know what to do, you can see a therapist to help you get through this difficult time."," Hello. I have to wonder about how you're being run from your happiness over the fact that you are not anymore and how you're letting this bother you.It sounds like you've had a complicated shock at the breakup. What surprised you was the fact that the two people you're talking to have very different opinions about the same stuff. For example, one person could not accept your involvement in a drug deal or your romantic involvement in a drug-related incident. The other could not accept that the involvement you're referring to is not related to this drug. Do you feel this is a coincidence?Probably so.Drug deals are a dime a mouth and usually aren't worth much if anything. The person who is taking the drug knows the deal is your investment in their behavior. It isn't a substitute for a more stable and loving partner who knows the deal.  It isn't a quick fix. It sounds like you're taking the risk of losing the relationship for you and it's likely you're trying to find a way to create some stability in the relationship. I'm not sure whether you're trying to make sense of what's going on and asking questions about that decision to stay together is a helpful way of trying to answer those questions. With this as the major question, I'd suggest asking yourself what kind of partner you are considering.  Do you want to be a happy, happy couple?  Do you want to be in a relationship where you're happy?  Do you want to be in a relationship where you're happy?  Do you want to be in a relationship where you're happy?  Is it possible you want to be in a relationship where you're happy and still feel happy?  Having these questions as a question and then trying to figure out what is the answer to your question is helpful because it will give you direction and guidance on how to decide whether it is good to be in a relationship or not"
26,I'm obsessing about a terrible breakup. Everything is a constant reminder. How do I move on?,"Breaking up can be a very difficult thing.  I'm sorry you're feeling badly.    The first thing is to be really sure you are taking care of yourself --- that means eating well, exercising, getting good sleep, spending time with friends/family and making sure you are taking care of important things like work, rent, bills etc.    Secondly, it's important to do things that make you feel better and not worse.   If looking up your ex on social media makes you feel worse stop doing it!   It's important to concentrate on you and not them.    Thirdly, it's super important to make sure you're really looking at the situation accurately and look for the good things that still exist in your life ---  what is still good?   Even though your emotions are hurting and you are feeling badly, can you see the light at the end of the tunnel?  Do you feel hope?  If you do try to concentrate on that hope feeling.   If the obsessing continues and really gets in the way of living your life?   Maybe contact a therapist or counsellor that can help you through this difficult time?"," I think the best thing for you is to have some patience for the right person. If you're having a conversation with someone about less important things like that, make sure you're not overreacting right now.

27,I'm obsessing about a terrible breakup. Everything is a constant reminder. How do I move on?,"Hi, Break ups can be very devastating and even traumatic. Recovering from one is a process that is unique for everyone person and will take time. It's important that you don't compare yourself to others. Each and every person will experience this grieving process differently. Here are a few tips to help with your recovery: 1. Make sure you surround yourself with people who love you and support you, friends and family. Even though you might feel like being alone, make an effort to be around them. 2. Although you might not feel like it, try to take care of yourself as much as possible: eat healthily, get regular sleep, & vigorous or gentle exercise (depending on your mood). The last thing that we want to do when we are physically sick (e.g. flu) is to take care of ourselves even thought that's what we need the most. But when we do get that chicken broth, sleep and vitamins we recover much faster and with less discomfort. That's exactly the same when it comes to emotional pain. Take care of yourself, keep yourself strong and healthy so you can recover faster. 3. As much as possible, put away reminders of the relationship. You might not be ready to throw things out, but try to put them away in a box in the storage or in a closet. And also block Social Media reminders. There is a lot of wisdom in the saying ""Out of Sight, Out of Mind."" 4. Once the initial shock and intensity of the break up wear off, try out something new. In a relationship, we often forget and give up on things that we always wanted to do or to try. Now it's time to bring out that dusty bucket list and start trying something new. 5. If possible, change your scenery by going away on vacation with a friend or even by yourself. Changing your surroundings can really help you change your thoughts, mindset and forget your ex even if just for a few hours. Even a weekend getaway with a couple of girlfriends can do wonders. 6. In addition, to help you make sense of your past relationship and what went wrong, I would highly recommend seeing a professional counsellor or therapist."," Since you're so self-critical, are you spending time thinking about the good things that have come since we had contact with each other and centering your thoughts around these thoughts?This is a great question!The brain can be a delicate organ. Its job is to keep the flags of all things that might be troubling you relatively.Its possible that at this early stage in your life, you have little or no awareness of the thoughts and emotions that are behind them.Consider what is making you feel happy, secure, connected, connected.  If you can think of what is making you feel unhappy, or if you believe these thoughts and emotions are trying to convince you that you need to leave them behind, then you can consider cutting off contact with those people"
28,I'm obsessing about a terrible breakup. Everything is a constant reminder. How do I move on?,"The best way to move on is to give yourself sufficient time and space away from your ex so you can heal.  That means no checking out your ex on social media platforms and no contact.  In order to move on and diminish the obsessions, help yourself recognize and accept that the relationship is over, and make sure to get sufficient support in processing all your feelings.  Once that takes place, it can be useful to explore and process with a professional the meaning of the relationship and to understand your part in what transpired.Sometimes people obsess because they have difficulties accepting what's already taken place and want things to be different.  The key to moving forward is to be loving toward yourself, to give yourself permission to grieve the loss, and to start cultivating new and healthy habits/patterns.  Reengage in your present life, ask yourself what you want your life to look like, and start creating goals and taking small steps to create the amazing life you want for yourself."," Hello. It sounds like you have a great time with your girlfriend and her intense interest in your life. How do you keep from obsessing about a bad breakup? First thing that you must do is recognize the problem your own and not to let your girlfriend define the direction the relationship is taking. She is the one the problem and she is the culprit. How do you repair your relationship after your own hurt and frustration? If you have a hard time getting your girlfriend to mend your relationship and repair your relationship after your own hurt and frustration, then you owe it to the relationship to have a female peer that you are a part of. They are responsible for determining what caused your partner's discomfort and what actions he took to repair the damage. They also need to make sure his/her own interest is served. Some degree of conflict is not the reason but the way the relationship was presented and how the two of you respond affects your ability to focus and react to the situation. You must both make their own determinations about what is best for the relationship. If you see your girlfriend as a threat to you then you do not have to tolerate this. As long as you both agree that you will not seek out physical violence or intimidation then the relationship is over. If neither of you agree then it is time to put your assets in escrow so that you can start working on your relationship. You cannot force her to go, but you can be willing to assume she will. I hope you will find her love and care"
29,I'm obsessing about a terrible breakup. Everything is a constant reminder. How do I move on?,"Let yourself know what you feel.   There is no timetable or known length of how much time a particular person requires in order to feel that the dissolved relationship is behind them.Probably the more you allow yourself to acknowledge your sadness from seeing the reminders, the sooner you will feel fresh and new again."," Since you're so self-critical, are you spending time thinking about the bad things that happened to you?This is a great place to start. Often when I talk to my clients about our clients problems.  We have had to move things around a lot. It's not that we don't like things, we just need to know that we are capable of moving on.  The key is to make sure that you are getting what you need from life.If you're getting your needs from other people (and this is also true for most people who emphasize life), you are obviously making some sacrifices. If you're making sacrifices because you're questioning your sanity or fear of being hurt in the bedroom, you are obviously making sacrifices that are somewhat necessary for your own happiness.The final important thing to note is whether or not you feel you can trust your therapist.   If you feel safe with your therapist, you probably want to make the right decision.  And the last important thing to note is that you can't trust your therapist to be the one who tells you what to do.   You can trust your therapist to first help you figure out what you need out of therapy and to help you find the information you need within yourself to guide your own decision"
30,"Ive been in an on an off relationship with a this man for almost 3 years. Even though I care about him, he continues to hurt me.    He and his wife were separated when we met. Now he's going through a really difficult divorce from her and is taking it really hard. I want to end this relationship, but I don't feel like I can. How can I let go?","Hello, and thank you for your question. Boy, ending relationships is tough, isn't it? Sometimes it's tough even when we are 100% sure that it is the right thing to do!I am going to give you some of my thoughts, and hopefully some colleagues will add some others. One of the things that I want to point out is that ""letting go"" is not really a thing. In other words, it's not really something you can reach out and grab. It's more of a process. This is good news, because you don't necessarily have to be at the end of the process to end an unhealthy relationship. We just have to accept that there will be feelings that come up even after the relationship is over. For example, someone can end an unhealthy relationship today, but then be reminded of the good times on what would have been their ""anniversary."" This could make the person very sad. They may even regret ending the relationship for a little while. It would important, then, for the person to remind themselves why the relationship needed to end, and that they are healthier because of it. This is relevant for you. It's hard to walk away from a relationship. We fear all kinds of things, including being single! Sometimes it's helpful to compare what you are getting out of the relationship to what you want from a relationship. It's helpful to be honest about what we have given up for an unhealthy relationship. It's fine to admit uncertainly about ending things. It's okay to be afraid. It's okay to have moments of doubt and sadness along with a dash of guilt. And even with all of that, someone can still leave if it is the healthiest thing for them. They can have sadness later on, and still not go back.It sounds like you are feeling responsible for making sure he is okay because of this divorce. The truth is that there is not necessarily a ""perfect"" time to end any relationship. There would be no guarantee that he would be doing any better after the divorce. Sometimes NOT making decisions stresses us out A LOT more than making a decision and living with the consequences, both good and bad. You may be at that crossroads. Be well..Robin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPC, NCC"," How sad for you!I'm sad that this made you want to cut off contact with the other.What do you think that keeps you from being able to connect with your husband?The answer matters because when the answer is yes, then you have to ask the right question.The question itself does not imply that there is something wrong with your marriage.The important thing to know is that what you are seeing is both possible and healthy in both ways.To be able to accept and continue to live the life that you are living, the relationship you had before this, the life you will live on forever, matters greatly in the long run.  Can you find another way to live?  Do you want to be connected to your husband because he is here because he is needed? You have the answers you need within yourself, but you can also be both content and you can be content only your own self.  You can never have both of these of your heart. If you can't be both content and healthy with one being satisfied and the other being not so much"

How can I let go?","First decide what you truly would like in the current relationship. Understand your reasons for staying in the relationship.Three years is a substantial amount of time to be involved with someone.   Whatever attachment you feel toward this man is deep and complex.Instead of deciding to leave or not leave, change your question to figuring out your satisfactions and dissatisfaction with the man. Also important is to tell the man your feelings.Whatever problem you are feeling may become clarified by discussing what bothers you.At the very least, you will give the guy a chance to show how interested he actually is in the tension you currently feel and have felt for a while."," Good for you on being sensitive to your human need for personal evolution.Wife and mother are meaningful positions.  And in your case, in order to feel your own growth, you will have to allow yourself to grow.Give yourself time.   At this stage in your life, you don't know what new or different you can do to change your situation.Since this is your problem, your mother's position is problematic.   Give yourself time to find something that makes you grow- something that you can control your actions.  When you have something that you know you can control yourself, then something like this, then you'll start to discover a lot of new ways to change your situation"
32,"My ex-boyfriend boyfriend and I lived together. He had a two year affair with a girl and had three pregnancies with her. One was an abortion, another was a miscarriage, and then she had the third baby. They are not together, but he continues to contact me and wants me back. He has nothing to offer me.","Hi Attica,This is a question I think a lot of people deal with...they feel confusion about why they can't forget about or get over (or stop connecting with) someone who they absolutely know isn't good for them. In your case, part of the problem is that he keeps trying to get back in touch with you. For some people, honestly, it's a game... to see how much power they have over you or it's their need to control you. If you don't want contact from this person, it's really important to give him clear messages about boundaries (""Don't contact me again""), and then ignore all of their communications. Any interactions or responses from you at all will feed their behaviour. Remind yourself why you don't want to be with them. I hear you doing that already when you say ""he has nothing to offer me"". That's great self-talk.But let's get back to the question of why we have a hard time letting go of people like this. Sometimes it's because we still hope they will change. Maybe we remember who they used to be or how they used to treat us, and we think it can go back to the way it felt in those ""good old days"". The problem there is that, over the first few years, as intimacy grows, people tend to show more of who they are, not less. So what they're eventually showing you is who they are and what they're capable of. People do change and grow, but it won't happen at your pace. Accept that person for who they are and stop expecting them to change. Another reason we can't let go is because we picture our ex with someone new in the future and we wonder if they will be a better person for the next partner in their life. This is a normal... but not a healthy... thought. It's as though we want them to stay, maybe apologize, and heal our hurts; maybe make up for past mistakes. You deserve that healing, you deserve better than you got, you deserve apologies, but to expect that from the person who hurt you and hasn't demonstrated that compassion as yet is probably foolhardy. It is my belief that underlying some of the above scenarios is the deep belief that we must somehow be responsible for the hurts our exes have caused. If you blame yourself in any way for someone's poor treatment of you, you will be dancing around trying to do things differently so that they can treat you better. It will be impossible to let go, because you blame yourself for their behaviours.Draw a line. Their behaviours are about them, not you, and the only solution is to challenge and reduce thoughts of them, and create physical and emotional distance. These things plus time will help the events of the past fade from importance."," Do the two of you ever talk over why you and your boyfriend broke up or what the reason is behind this?From what you write, you're both curious about the miscarriage and want to know what exactly is going on with your current boyfriend.I suggest you focus on answering this person directly.   The more you try to uncover the more likely they will trust you"
33,I keep on begging him to come back. I am so unhappy with him but am so scared of being a single parent to our son. I was abused as a little girl and that has made to be very abusive to men. What should I do...,"Major change frightens almost everybody.Don't be so afraid of your fear that you let yourself beg and are willing to accept unhappiness as a standard in your marriage.If you start considering that life can be better than what is current for you now, new possibilities and ideas will start developing in your mind.Consider finding a therapist so that you have private space to talk in detail about your fears and the new ways of seeing your Self.A therapy relationship, since it is safe and supportive, will be a good balance to having been abused, suffered, and unhappy."," Hi New Jersey,You talk about two very big changes in your life that have been very traumatic for you. The first is a drastic change in your attitude. Your husband was released from prison three times (once for a minor offense and once for a felony). He came out to you and told you he was released from prison altogether. He was released on $5,000 bail.  Now that you have been released he is on a $5,000,000 bond. Am I right that he should get a new bond? The other thing that sometimes happens is a new person starts to ask for and receive sex from someone else. This is one of those situations where a new person gets a bond, which usually lasts a few years. You can always ask the person your question and ask them to get a new understanding and compassion for what you are going through.I believe that a new relationship can last or be formed. It's never about what everyone else says. It's about who you are. I have known a few guys for a long time who were successful in getting people to like and leave them with sex. He might be curious to know the details of what happens to him over time. He doesn't care. He just wants to get sex.That's all I can say. Wishing you the best"
34,"My friend’s husband is bipolar and refuses to take medication for it. He has taken the wheels off her vehicle before to prevent her from leaving. He has held her a prisoner in her home. He has choked her, hit her, etc. She has almost divorced him a couple of times but always makes up with him, thinking that he is going to change. She and I went to a wedding out of town in September of 2014, and ever since she has been back, he is convinced that she cheated on him while we were gone. Now he is saying that I have also cheated on my boyfriend and has come to my house and told my boyfriend this.","I’m glad that you  are seeking help and that you are supporting your friend. I’m sure this is all overwhelming and frustrating for you. The biggest thing you can do for your friend is to be supportive as you are already doing. Unfortunately there isn’t much you can do for her outside of that because it is up to her husband to change and up to your friend if she wants to leave. There are things you can do to support more: it might be helpful for her to have some information on a domestic violence non profit in her area because they can assist her in many areas if she wants to leave. They can also provide you with support while you go through this with her. The nonprofit can also safety plan with her and it might be helpful for you to do it with her if you want to. Another thing you can do is support her in decision to stay with her husband or not despite what she decides. Many victims decide to stay with thier abusive partner for many reasons. It is important to support her decisions, even if you don’t agree with them, because she may have very little decision making in her relationship. I would also encourage you to make sure you are taking care of yourself while you support her so you are not becoming too overwhelmed. Here is some info that might be helpful to you. https://abuseintervention.org/sandbox77/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/How-to-Help-a-Loved-One.pdf","question: My friend’s husband is bipolar and refuses to take medication for it.

Now he is saying that I have also cheated on my boyfriend and has come to my house and told my boyfriend this. context: I’m glad that you are reaching out for help. The first thing that I want to know is, is, who is this guy telling you to feel?  What do you see in the past of this guy that would benefit from honest communication? Is he telling you he's the one in control of his life, or is he telling you he's the one to make sure that your life is safe? If he is the former then talking with a therapist is a good idea. It will help to address whether the relationship is still or going to be a healthy one and how, if true, it would be good for the two of you to talk about how it would be better for the two of you if one of you remained in the relationship. If true, it would be good for you both to explain your position very clearly and explain why you both want to remain in the relationship. If the relationship is being harmful to the two of you, then you want to explain to him the harmful relationship you both have and why you both want to remain in the relationship. If the relationship is being beneficial to the both of you, then it would be good to explain why you both want to remain in the relationship and how you both can make that happen. If the relationship is not being beneficial to the both of you, then it would be even better to leave the relationship. I don't know that it's the former's business whether the two of you can remain in the relationship unless there are some legal complications that prevent that. If the two of you can't talk about what each other wants or what is best for each of you, then it would be good to see if there is anything you can do to get your license to practice in the state that it is in. If there is no such thing as being healthy here, then it would be possible to abstain from all substances, but not alcohol, weed, or sex. If the two of you can't talk about anything beyond this being a ""health problem"", then it would be time to actually start looking into couples therapy for couples therapy. I don't know how old you are, but if you are between 15 and 35, that can be a really big help for you. If you are able to save money and do other things that you enjoy, that may be something you could work with depending on what your niece is up to. I know she is, and I don't deny him the enjoyment that comes with that, but it would be so important to have someone there to help her understand that. If there is no one there to help her understand that, then it doesn't mean there is something wrong with him. There is obviously something wrong with her, but there is nothing that anyone can do to change their former partner. I think it would be really cool to have a therapist do some self-care and to talk with him a lot about what might be helping her. A lot of times, when someone is worried about him, it is really helpful to have a therapist or some other support in place before he starts to have these fears. He may be a good listener to talk with you about how he is feeling, but he doesn't have the ability to understand what the fear is that he needs to understand what the fear is like. So, it is really helpful for the both of you to have a plan in place to process the fears between you; to make sure that you are both aware of the danger and make sure that you take reasonable care of yourself about your position.As far as whether your husband will talk to you, he may feel like he is just as scared about it as you are about him. Also, depending on what you mean about wanting to wait or to discuss this with him, some partners may feel that they can understand in what direction to wait or not talk about this. This can be a very difficult conversation and the two of you can have a conversation if that is the case. Let him know what is difficult about talking with him.I don't know what you think about the idea that he doesn't want to talk?If he does have the right to do so, then this is a great opportunity for you to have a conversation about what you would like him to do so that he understands the meaning of the conversation and what you want him to do so tha"

He tells me although I help him doesn’t mean that I am a good person. He always discredits me as a woman and it’s hurtful. I spend most day crying and feeling lonely. I am unhappy and unsure of what I need to do.","That sounds like a very hurtful situation. Unfortunately, without a batterers intervention course or a desire to change, the abuse cycle is unlikely to stop. I do not recommend that you try to leave on your own due that being the most dangerous time when in an abusive relationship. As an abuser, his goal is to control you whether it's through mental or verbal means. I recommend that you contact a domestic violence shelter in your area. I have worked closely with Harbor House of Central Florida and know they provide housing, transportation, and any other needed resources to women leaving an abusive relationship. There is help out there and you are not alone. If you need any additional resources in your area, please don't hesitate to contact me."," Hi Smyrna,Your first sentence says it all. He's a cheater. Cheating is something unacceptable for you. What are your own thoughts on this? I hope some other people's thoughts are helpful. I hope some others are better or more helpful.

Share a moment with a trusted friend or therapist. It's easy to do. Reflect a little more on what you realize you matter to others. Are you an emotional connection that you can share with someone? Are you a person that you can be emotional with? Are you a good listener? Are you emotional about food and drink? What kind of relationship are you?

It sounds like there is some confusion about sexual intimacy from both of you.Couples counseling would be a great place to start. All of these areas need to be explored before any treatment goals can be established.You need to talk with a professional counselor to explore how to better connect with your spouse."," I am sorry to hear of your husband's sudden sudden change of heart.  There is a good chance he did not disclose this to the other partner, and in order for this to be beneficial, the husband needs to be protected from his actions.  And in addition to him being afraid to speak to his ex about his feelings, he may believe it is him doing the talking. The ex's job is to prepare the two of you for any difficult situations that come up.  If the husband is not ready for this conversation, it makes sense that he would first want to prepare himself for any difficult future conversations with his ex.  Then he will have a better idea of what he can do to prepare.  Good luck"

You don't say whether he complains or not, but even if he doesn't it seems there's a sense of something important missing for both of you.Most likely to connect better with him physically you'll need to become better connected with yourself and your body. Men often feel fulfilled by sex simply because it happened - the woman they want received them, allowed them to make love with her. For women that can sometimes be more complicated. A woman who loves sex most likely also loves her body, knows what pleasures her, and feels confident asking for what she wants. Self-pleasuring can be a way for you to discover more about your sexuality, and a classic resource is Betty Dodson's book Sex for One: The Joy of Selfloving. A good counselor or sex therapist can be very helpful with your whole relationship as well as the sexual part of it, but not all counselors are comfortable working with sexual issues. Shop around and be sure you find someone who can help you and your husband get better connected on all levels."," Maybe your husband doesn't know you want to be better or have a desire to make you better?Since he says he doesn't know, you can ask him if he's aware of how he feels about your sex life and whether he feels the same way about it.If he is aware of how he feels, then yes, you should tell him.If he is unaware of how he feels about your sex life, then you should ask him"

This does not mean that they only specialize in sexual addiction, but they do have special training in discussing sexual elements of relationships and their training is quite extensive.In addition to connecting sexually, you may consider discussing with your husband whether each of you are aware of things that make you feel valued, special, loved, and appreciated.

Sexual intimacy is an important part of many people's life, but how much importance is placed on it varies from couple to couple. The first step would be to have an open conversation with your husband. It's important you are both open about what you desire from sexual intimacy and how much intimacy each one of you wants. For example, asking your husband how often does he want to have sex/ week or /month. When having this conversation, it's important that you are both respectful and open with each other. The point of the conversation is to get to know each other and not to solve a problem, yet. There are couples who enjoy fulfilling platonic/friendship relationships with minimal or no sex because both partners are not interested in it. If you are both on the same page - lack of sex might not be a problem. If there is a difference in your sex drive and frequency of desire, I would recommend seeing a professional relationship & sex therapist as a couple to help you explore your current sexual dynamic, what's creating it, what's getting in a way of connecting sexually and to assist you and your husband in finding creative solutions."," Maybe your husband doesn't know you want to be better or have a sex drive that's different than your sex drive.Maybe he doesn't want to help you feel validated by the idea that he's the one in the position to make you feel that connection.I'm curious about why this is the case for both of you.Do you notice that your sex drive is the same as the one across the board?  Are you satisfied with your marriage as it is? If so, where did the energy come from?What does your husband want from the marriage?What does your husband love about you? Does he care for you?  Does he care for you?  Does his kids love you?  Do you feel he does care?  Do you care for him in any way?  Do you care for him?  And who is he/she that he is able to be silent and have a conversation with your husband without you having to ask questions?Basically, there is no good reason for you to continue seeing him without asking questions.If he doesn't want to talk to you because you're asking questions, then there are several things you can do to make him feel less heard.Here are some things:Ask a question.  Ask his permission.  Ask for what he needs.  Get a list of family and friends who want to support you.  Get a contract with him to do this.  Please reach out.If he doesn't want to talk, then again you probably should talk to someone who knows him and/or see if there's anything that you can do to make him feel more involved in his life"
43,"My husband and I have been married for seven years, and in that time, we have only had sex four or five times. Others have told me that most men would have left me by now. Honestly, I think I have a low sex drive or neither one of us actually knows what we are doing. I want to be better connected with my husband.","I work with many couples that experience a wide range of sexual and relationship challenges. The one aspect I tell many folks that I work with, is this: Every person and relationship is different. There really isn't a ""normal"" amount of sex a person should have or want to have. If having sex 4 to 5 times in the course of your relationship is satisfying to you and your husband, there is nothing wrong with it. If you or your husband would like to have sex more often, I suggest talking with a counselor about this to find ways to engage in a sexual life in which you are both satisfied. The aspect of connectedness is an important one. While sex can be very connecting for many couples, it isn't the only way to connect. I find that communication about the matter of frequency of sex, checking in to see how you and your husband feel, as well as communicant about your needs for connection are an important start to fulfilling this need."," Maybe your husband doesn't know you want to be better or have a sex drive that's not related to sex. He may feel like he wants to be with you and that you're not related. Perhaps you do want to know the secrets he puts up with your bf.There's no way to know whether your husband will listen to your sex wishes or not. If he is listening, try to listen as one person does not equal one another"
44,"I'm in my early 20s, and I've been seeing my boyfriend for a year now. My boyfriend has always been the sweetest guy until recently. He has made comments such as “you would look better as a Tumblr girl"" or ""you should start doing more squats."" It's really hurtful.","My first thought was that I wondered what changed recently. Is he open to having a discussion about this so you can ask questions such as that one?It's possible that he does not understand the degree to which it hurts you.Try asking if there is a time that would be good to have a discussion that is important. I don't know how well the two of you have communicated over the last year, but if you are concerned about this turning into an argument, you may consider asking him to just listen to your point of view and see if he is able to summarize it correctly.

He has made comments such as “you would look better as a Tumblr girl"" or ""you should start doing more squats."" It's really hurtful.","Hello, and thank you for your question. I am very sorry that you are experiencing this. To be honest, this kind of behavior is really emotionally abusive, and you likely know that already. The unfortunate truth is, there is very little we can actually do to change another adult's behavior if they are not interested in changing it. Many people who behave in this way actually feel justified in saying what they say, or even believe that they are ""helping"" in some way by telling you how to improve yourself. What is actually going on is an attempt to control or change something about you by being coercive and abusive. It is important to know that this kind of behavior doesn't necessarily show up right away. That is why I am not surprised that you are a year in to this relationship and are just now noticing these behaviors. Some people actually don't see them until they are already married! You didn't mention that there has been any physical abuse, but I would warn you that this is sometimes a possibility once a person has already begun to be emotionally abusive. Other things to watch out for is your boyfriend trying to control who you hang out with, what you do and how you dress, etc. These are just more examples of emotional abuse and control. Here are some things to consider and some ideas:1. You could talk to your boyfriend about this behavior, if you believe it is safe to do so. Perhaps he will recognize that his behavior is not okay, and change. If not, then you may need to decide what you want to do about this relationship, given the fact that you cannot force him to change. 2. You can call a local domestic violence program. They do not only work with people who have been physically abused or have been married. They are trained to talk about emotional abuse, also. It may be a good thing for support. Your calls are confidential. 3. Check out the wheel in the link below. On it you will find some other common ways that abuse can happen in a relationship. If any of these are happening to you, or begin to happen, talking to a domestic violence program, a trusted friend or family member, or a counselor would be a good idea. http://www.domesticviolence-wilm.org/Portals/97/Images/violence_wheel.gif  Be well.... Robin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPC, NCC"," Hi. I appreciate your honesty. squats is a very specific description of your body type.  The way your description fits with other areas of your life is that you are probably a very picky person and when you try to identify what qualities you like about yourself, you are usually met with the response of ""you're too picky!"" from the other person.  This is a very unhealthy relationship and can demoralizing.  It is really a good thing you are self aware and your descriptions need to be followed through.  You may want to  begin therapy to address these traumatic experiences and any lingering issues that may be contributing to your depression.  There is hope and you can make the choice to start somewhere.  The ultimate goal, then, is to find the therapist and begin a healing process of healing from your past and present suffering.  It's the ultimate goal.  You can Present your healing at the things you care about and begin to move forward.  You can Present your healing at the things you care about and begin to move forward.  ...that's what you needed to do"
46,"My fiancé and I have almost the best relationship every girl wants, but lately it's changed. I get less attention and little to no intercourse. He works a lot and goes to the gym a lot (he's a football player for an indoor league), but he has no time for me. We live two hours from family, and when I leave home to see family, he'll text me saying ""whatever"" and ""leave me alone."" But when we're together, everything is okay. No fighting or anything. I love this man, but I just don't know what to do anymore.","Hello, It doesn't feel good when it seems that your partner no longer cares or cares less for you, especially if your feelings have not changed. It can be scary, frustrating, and lonely. Have you tried talking to him about your concerns? I would suggest to start there. There may be several reasons for his actions, some of which may have nothing to do with how he feels for you. Learning about what is going on for him will likely answer your questions and, depending on his response, may cause some relief. When initiating conversations about subjects that are sensitive, there are a few things that you want to remember. Tell him how you are feeling and what you are experiencing, rather than blaming him or telling him what he is doing wrong. Avoid using extreme, black and white language (i.e. always and never). For example, you may say something such as, ""I feel confused that we are rarely intimate and I'm wondering if you've also noticed this change"" versus ""You are never intimate with me anymore."" Don't be afraid to ask him questions. You deserve to know what is going on, as his behavior is effecting your well being. I like to ask open-ended questions instead of yes and no questions. It allows for more clarity and deeper explanation. Lastly, ask yourself (and possibly him) what part you play in the recent changes. Does he feel that you've been distant? Does he need something from you? Let him know that you are willing to work things out as a team. If communication attempts fail, seeing a couple's therapist can be a great benefit. Having an objective party to coach you through this difficut time can give you the support that will create lasting changes in your relationship.Best of luck to you!", I'm sorry that you are having such a difficult time with this situation.  I would offer my thoughts and theories as to what may be creating your difficulty.  I'm not sure what all of this means exactly.  Maybe it means that you just don't like the fact that your boyfriend is talking to you and thinks you're annoying and doesn't interest you?  Maybe you need some kind of reason to stay in the relationship and not engage in the sex life with him.  Maybe you need a time to think about what made you stop communicating and instead make use of it to reach out.  Remember that you can only guarantee future well-being to yourself and your partner

Hmmm...Is it that you don't fight because you don't bring up what's bothering you? Are you avoiding conflict? Many people do. What do you fear would happen if you let him know how you feel about his recent pulling away? As an engaged couple, now is a really good time to see what happens when you bring a concern to your fiance. Better to find out now what happens when you rock the boat by being real. Or maybe you have spoken to him about it. If so, what happens? Does he listen and help you understand him better? Or does he avoid and reassure you...or maybe dismiss you? This is really important data to gather about how your fiance handles conflict and how you work together. He says ""leave me alone"". That's a pretty bold statement about what he wants. He doesn't seem to have the same idea that you do about what marriage is, and how close you want to be. Plus, I have to say, those words sound more like what a closed-off fourteen year old would say to a parent than a loving fiance to his bride to be! Giving him the benefit of the doubt, it could be that your fiance is scared about getting married and this is a temporary reaction that will change. But if this is true, he needs to tell you that so you can understand. So, I suggest that the fact that when you're together you're ""okay"" is perhaps not the best barometer for how you're doing as a couple. Listen to your gut. I encourage you to be really open with your fiance about what your feelings and fears are. This may get rockier before it gets better, but until you face what's not working, you won't know who you truly are as a couple.  When you're engaged, it's a really cool time to see a therapist too...to get some conflict resolution skills down before you're a married couple."," I'm sorry that you are having such a tough time with this. I'm glad that you are aware of the negative effects on your relationship that may be coming from engaging in nonsexual touching.

49,"I've been with my husband for eight years now. We have split twice before, and the first time was because he cheated. I took him back months later, and he really tried making it up to me by making a lot of changes. However, we continued to have issues because of my lack of trust. My insecurities and trust issues lead to physical abuse, which lead to us separating again. During that separation, he consoled himself by talking to the same girl he cheated on me with. But we then ended up back together and worked it out for a while until I got pregnant with our second child.
   The baby was a few months old, and he confessed to me about his secret relationship with her. He told me how he could never stop talking to her and how, during our issues, she has been and is the only women he's gone behind my back with (but on a friendship level because she's miles away). He confessed how he fought feelings for her and feels like he's possibly in love with her too. He said he feels like he's in love with the both of us now because this women has fallen for him, and she hasn't been able to leave him alone since. Even though she knows that he's still with me and happy with our family, she can’t help it, and he confessed how his feeling for her are mutual. Being that he loves me too, he wanted to be with the both of us at the same time. He wanted to have affairs with her behind my back by flying her out and staying at a hotels, but he didn't want me to find out, so he told me everything. He said he didn't want to continue to lie to me and so I can finally stop accusing him of being with other women when it's only been this one girl the whole time. He feels like my insecurities and trust issues are what pushed him closer towards her, and that no matter what he did to do right, I would still accuse him. He's caught up in his feelings and pretty much says that he wants her but doesn't want me to leave him because I'm the one he wants to be with for the rest of his life.
   I'm of course hurt and in shock. I feel like I have to make a decision on whether I want to allow it and deal with having to share him or walk away. Both of these decisions are really hard to make because I feel like whether I stay or go, my heart will still be torn apart. I have to make a decision quick because she will be flying out sooner than I thought.","Hi Jayuya, I'm struggling in this moment with my own biases. I have biases that are about respect and every individual's need for and right to respect. Your husband lies, cheats and physically hurts you. He makes excuses and blames you for these behaviours and trains you to do the same. He demonstrates many controlling and abusive behaviours. And now, in an attempt to manipulate and silence you, he wants to have his cake and eat it too and suggests you should share him? There aren't many crumbs of this cake left for you, are there?So, my biases about respect don't make me want to rescue you or tell you what to do; I can't do that, and I don't think either of those things will help you. I'd like to ask you some questions though...Are you happy? Do you know what happy is? Do you know what respect is? Are your children safe? Are your children witnessing violence (because if they are, then they're not safe)? Do you have supports? Do your family and friends know what's happening in your life? Have you ever been to a women's shelter? Are you willing to sit down in an office with a professional who can help you think clearly? That's what I suggest. These are big decisions, you deserve some support. I wish you the best."," I think the hardest part for you is trusting yourself to follow your husband's rules.  ""You're not doing what he wants me to do, but I don't want to spoil anything for him.""If you're really honest with yourself about this, you'll feel better because you're letting your husband know you feel frustrated and unsure about your relationship.  He might be a good parent, but you won't feel guilty if you feel like he is doing something  unethical.These two of you didn't suggest that there be an ethical affair.  There should be an ethical affair.  It might help to have a conversation about the details of this issue with him.  The discussion will focus on the two of you and your relationship with him.  It might be something that  the two of you should reach out to.  You can also contact the couple marriage therapist at any time to discuss any concerns that you have.The couple marriage therapist also agrees that it would be helpful to speak with someone from the couple to sort through these issues"
50,"My wife is trying to leave. She agreed to come back and give me a little time. Even said she hopes I can do it. We buried our first born in Jan 13 years ago. She never got past it. So every year around this time, she gets emotional and says she doesn't think she loves me, but then we go back to normal. This time, another guy came in and showed her attention. I'll forgive the cheating if she'll come home.","I'm sorry that you lost your first born child.  Death of a child always leaves a permanent reminder to the parents of a very painful time in their lives.The good news is your awareness that you and your wife are not connected in a satisfying way.There are many possible areas to examine in your relationship as partners and as parents.If what you write here are your observations and theories about your wife's outlook and conclusions, then the first step is to directly have conversations together on the topics you write here.What needs clarifying is what her reasons are for wanting to leave the marriage.Often, a crisis such as a child's death, motivates someone to look deeply into other intimate relationships.  Keep in mind that looking deeply doesn't necessarily mean leaving the marriage.Also, be aware of your own frustrations and marital discontent.  Be ready to talk about your feelings and uncertainties.There is no such thing as one happy partner in a marriage and one unhappy partner.   Each person is part of a system and can only be as satisfied as their partner.The conversations that open relationship hurts and disappointments, hold a lot of emotion.  They are difficult to keep on track.Best recommendation is to find a couples therapist who will be neutral to each of you as individuals, and help both of you examine the true health of the relationship."," Forgiving and untrained a pregnant woman who is envious of you.You're description of each other, suggests a delicate balance of caretaker and partner; both of whom are capable of caring for the woman seriously (if you are not already fully equipped to handle this).The woman is cared for and released from the woman's grasp.The two of you--you can be both open to healing and releasing yourself from the woman's clutches.The key to feeling secure and safe is to identify how you each feel about the other, once and for all.  Once you feel safe enough to do this, the next step is to identify how you would like to feel about that other person in the future.

51,What can I do to stop grieving my mother’s death? When I am awake I just cry every day. I don't have anyone to talk to. I need help; I am still cry over her. Will I ever stop crying? It’s been 3 years.,"I am sorry that you lost your mother. That is a really hard thing for someone to go through.There is really no set time for grief to be over, but I agree that if it has been three years and you are still crying every day then this is past the time for normal grief. I do not know how old you are and if you are in school or have a job, but I would imagine that if by now you literally were doing nothing but crying every day all day, someone would have noticed and would have gotten you some help. For one thing, bills have to be paid.There are typically five stages of grief and they can come in any order. You can go back to another stage that you previously experienced. Denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance are the stages. At first, people are usually in denial over the fact that they lose someone or are losing someone. This may mean that you deny they are ill or deny that they have actually died.Then comes bargaining, in which you may beg God that if you can only have this person back then you will do whatever. Depression is when the reality has settled in and when we cry and really feel the loss. It sounds like you are stuck in this phase.Finally, acceptance is when we accept that it has happened and we pick up the pieces of our life and move on.When we lose someone we never forget them. We may always have certain days that are tough, such as holidays or any special remembrance of your loved one. But we do get to the place where we accept that death is part of life and that it is inevitable, and that life goes on.A therapist can help you explore the reasons for your extended grief and can help you with coping skills to better deal with it. One suggestion I have is not to try to run from the sad feelings, don’t try to not feel them. Embrace the feelings. Let the feelings wash over you and accept them. Trying not to feel something is not going to help. Sadness is a part of life and needs to be felt just like happiness does. Unpleasant feelings are not to be avoided.I am sincerely sorry that you lost your mother and that you have had such a hard time of it for three years now. You deserve to be happy and to live a full life. I am sure your mother would not want you being sad for so long. I wish you all the best as you continue to try to heal from this loss and deal with your grief.", I am so sorry to hear about your loss. I know how lonely and hurt you feel. Settle in okay. Are you ready to move on? What I would suggest is to accept your loss and live a meaningful life with yourself a partner who is not sad or sad. Set the mood and be kind to yourself. Don't blame your mother. Set some boundaries for yourself.  Make it fun.  Seriously try to not hit her. She was a great mom and you will always be a great parent.  Best of luck to you. Best of luck to you. I suggest you to see a therapist who can help you with all of this. I hope this was helpful.

52,"I'm a female in my mid 20s. Lately I tend to over drink and I've become a very angry drunk.    In the past, I have even cheated on my boyfriend while I was under the influence of alcohol.    But now, even if I don't do anything wrong and don't embarrass myself, I still feel really guilty after a night of drinking. I don't understand why I'm feeling this way. Does this mean I have a problem?","Hello, I commend you for your courage in taking a look at the role alcohol has in your life. It sounds like you're concerned about what happens when you drink too much and I suspect you already know the answer to your question about whether you have a problem or not. I imagine you would like to stop feeling guilty and would like to avoid cheating on your boyfriend or other negative consequences and maybe have a fear of being or becoming an ""addict"" or ""alcoholic."" You might have a ""problem"" but that does not necessarily mean that you are an addict. I don't have information to know if ""addiction"" or ""dependence"" or other words would best describe where you are with drinking, but it sounds like it's begun to have some negatives, so forgive me using words like addict, dependence and so on. I mean it more as a road map than a diagnosis. The feedback I'm writing here is very general and doesn't address physical dependence and many other factors that might apply to your situation.  One of the ways to think about substance (mis)use is to think of addiction as a disease of avoidance. Let me repeat that: it is a disease of avoidance. Your ultimate task in living a balanced life is to figure out what you're avoiding and develop other ways to manage those feelings, experiences, and so on. And of course, along the way, you may want to look at triggers, situations, biological vulnerability, social pressures, coping skills, relapse prevention planning and so on. Depending on where you are in your drinking, you might very well benefit from expertise and support. Remember also that alcohol depresses our central nervous system and disinhibits us. That means that alcohol is often a substance of choice to relax, destress, calm down, etc. Also, it allows feelings, thoughts, and behaviors that we usually inhibit to be expressed. If you were unfaithful and often angry, that's your first signpost. For angry drinkers, it is often true that you don't drink and then get angry, you drink in order to express anger. I recommend you find someone you can speak frankly with, who is knowledgeable about addiction. Wishing you the best health and wellness."," You may be interested in reading my most recent post, Intimacy Begins With You.

There are also grieving rituals that you do each day to try to help the other person. Sometimes lying is okay. It's also an appropriate time to sit with a therapist to figure out what's going on. Perhaps you can have a conversation with your boyfriend about what you both want, wish for, and desire from one another. As you examine these things, you will find what I call a ""triangulation"" of feelings. One person feels greatly affected by the events of the past with another person feeling greatly affected by the events of the past. The problem is that we tend to think that we need to rely on a third party to help us see the ugly parts of things. Not really. The thing that really is helping is that you are aware of your own tendency to blame yourself for things when you are not the one doing the blaming. For example, if you are the one who is the one who is the one causing the drinking, you will likely be able to move forward with a plan. You can also discuss this with a therapist as an individual, but this is important. Also, contact the police. If you feel like your boyfriend is in your way to blame you for things like not reporting the problem, you can hold him accountable for what he does. He may be an honest person who is not at all aware of what they are doing. If he continues to hide the truth, you can keep your feelings (and actions) secret from him. I hope this was helpful.

But now, even if I don't do anything wrong and don't embarrass myself, I still feel really guilty after a night of drinking. I don't understand why I'm feeling this way. Does this mean I have a problem?",Speaking with a licensed therapist will help you figure out if indeed you have a problem or not.  I would say the first question you should ask yourself is why you are drinking? The second would be why you feel the need to drink in excess? It may be due to a life event or the crowd you are running with.  Either way a therapist will be able to help you through this as you already made the first step in admitting you are having a difficult time.," For what it' s worth, you are right to be concerned about your own way of handling certain situations.  You may want to take a look at his side of the story and try to unpack what the problem is from your own perspective and perspective.  Sometimes we assume that handling a problem puts us in a good place but it really is that the problem is not so bad.  The problem is that you did nothing wrong and you seem to have no interest in dealing with it.  The next step is to see if you can figure out where the anger comes from. What are the roots of the problem? What can you can do to create change in your life so you can be successful? You can also contact a therapist and ask them to help you figure out where the anger comes from. Then you can schedule a follow-up appointment with your therapist"

But now, even if I don't do anything wrong and don't embarrass myself, I still feel really guilty after a night of drinking. I don't understand why I'm feeling this way. Does this mean I have a problem?","Usually when someone asks if they have a problem, they believe they do have a problem!The first step is to understand your own theory and definition as to what problem you feel you have.  Some possibilities are feeling unhappy in the relationship to your boyfriend, not having enough discussion between the two of you, not feeling cared about by your boyfriend, not liking your boyfriend.Did you grow up in a family in which the grownups drank to the point of excess at the times they felt stressed?Family modeling of how to handle problems may have left you no knowing how to handle stress except to drink to excess.Ask yourself what it is you feel guilty of doing?The guilt may point you in a good direction if it is your sense of self-esteem telling you to find better ways of managing your life.Do you drink alone or together with friends?Try defining your specific reasons for drinking because this is the first step to know how to handle the situation differently."," For what it's's's's's own sake' sake, I'm unable to tell you what the problem is. But you're entitled to your own opinion on whether you feel embarrassing or a problem. In the end, if it's just a "" problem "", then sure, you can ask yourself why you'd want to continue to do this if the problem is with you. But not if you've been under the influence of drugs or whatever else you've been drinking. I suggest you take the time to examine the source of your motivation for drinking. Is it to finish school or to go to college? Are you stuck?  Do you want to change the things that have made you happy? If this is the case, you probably have other things in mind.  Other things that you can use such as activities to make you happy: exercise, doing some exercise, doing some activities in nature, and learning a new skill.  If the alcohol is not the problem, you can try some that may help you feel better.  However, don't let the type of behavior you're causing behind the behavior stand out as being cheating. You could also talk to your boyfriend about your time at the hospital and see if he's able to change.  If it's found that he's not the problem, you can let him know that you think he is the problem.  You can also contact the United States Attorney's Office in New York for an internal complaint making of these things.

58,"I'm in love with my own gender, and my parents are against that. I don't know how to tell them because I'm afraid they'll not want me anymore.","Hello, and thank you for your question. This is one of those times when you wish you could assure someone that everything will go perfectly, but unfortunately I can't do that. There is no way of knowing how parents might respond until you tell them. The truth is that people have come out to their parents in many different ways. Some have told their parents directly, some drop hints, some have had others tell their parents, etc. The only ""right"" way to come out is the one that you choose. The one that feels right to you. That is the best way. Some people decide not to come out, and some wait for a very long time. Both of these things are okay. Coming out is deeply personal, and there can be real consequences to someone's emotional health and safety if they tell the wrong person. That is why it should only be done when you are ready. When you feel that you have the emotional and personal support that you need to take the risk. Sometimes people can feel pressured to come out, but I encourage you to do it in your own time. The truth is, there is a spectrum of how people's parents react to this kind of news. On one end, you may have the parents who shut a person out and are abusive, and on the opposite side you may have parents that are totally okay with it and throw you a ""Coming Out"" party. Most parents are going to fall somewhere in the middle. It is important to remember that their feelings may change over time. Many parents struggle at first, but they love their kids and get better with it over time. If you decide to tell them, consider taking someone along to support you. Plan ahead on what you want to say. It can be an emotional time, so do what you need to do to take care of yourself. If you need to, leave. You don't have to stay anywhere where someone is being cruel to you. I wish you well, and good luck.Robin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPC, NCC"," Hello. It seems you are in a unique position to decide to tell your parents. The fact that you are willing to give it your all and tell your parents what matters to you is a gift to both of you. You and your parents will likely find a way to treat you the same way. If you are still feeling like you want to tell your parents what you feel, that might be a way to start. It doesn't hurt between you to provide feedback on where your feelings are and where your feelings are coming from. If you feel your parents are not accepting of your gender, or if they are judging you to be a certain way, that is a different story. It is up to the parents to make the decisions about what is best for you. If you are feeling like you want to tell your parents what you feel, that is a different story. I hope this was helpful.

59,"I've been hurt by a man for five years. He doesn't involve me with the family or kids. Everyone in the family is against me. There is a Mass today for a family member, and he never asked me to go. I'm to sit home alone now and Christmas too. He expects me to sit alone while he enjoys being with the family. We are in our 50s, and it hurts that he won't even think of me or involve me as part of the family. He doesn't even care. I am leaving him as soon as possible, but I hurt so bad that I didn't know who to turn too. I'm now in this low funk of depression, and I'm scared because I do stupid things to myself and give up. I have no friends because I was a truck driver. I've been getting serious headaches and can't sleep. I don't eat; I've lost my appetite. This has been going on for a couple weeks now.","Hi Florida,I get the sense that, aside from this relationship, you're quite isolated in general. It's sad that you're feeling excluded at Christmastime and family events. While I would suggest that you don't really know what he or his family are thinking or feeling (you assume they're against you, and that he doesn't care), he is certainly behaving in a very distant, excluding manner and it's understandable that you would feel rejected and hurt. How long has this part been happening? Has he always acted this way, or is it more recent? Did something happen recently? You mentioned doing ""stupid things to yourself"", and I don't know what that means. If you are engaging in self-harm he may be confused about what to do and he might need some time to think and be separate but is having trouble talking about this. Part of the problem, of course, is that you don't know what's going on for him. Certainly, you deserve the truth, and if he doesn't want to spend time with you, I would hope he would be honest. Have you been open to hearing the truth from him? Is there any reason for him to hesitate to tell you why he's being distant? Maybe you could ask him, if you are ready to hear.I'm glad to hear that you believe that you deserve a full, loving relationship, although it seems that moving forward might be difficult for you. Is it possible your happiness is a bit too dependant on this man? I'm just guessing, based on what you've said here.  It seems that it's possible your situation has led to some depression, and I would recommend a session with a qualified therapist to help you sort this out. You will need support, even if the relationship is repaired. Best of luck."," Hey, if you're going through some rough patches, why not give yourself a little time and grace by approaching your situation with an open mind! You don't have to continue to do this stuff for sure for sure, but if you're willing to give it a try, there are ways to honor your past and move past these moments of uncertainty. I suggest a few things. First, think about what you would like for yourself and why you want to do this. Are you going to take advantage of an opportunity like this? If so, it might be good to restate what you think you will get out of doing this. Secondly, think about what you would like for yourself and your relationship. What are the things that make you happy, important things in life?  If we are willing, I would encourage you to think about what you would like for yourself and make sure you are clear about what you are looking for.  There are lots of ways to guide and explore an individual's true feelings about his or her situation.  If you have confidence that's is's great, think of how you would like to be transparent.  Then of course after a brief discussion ask how you would like to proceed.  The discussion should be about the points that you think you are able to address and questions you would like answers to.  I encourage you to think of questions that are basically instructions for how and when you would like to talk to your parents.  The parents should be able to guide you in best regards. The important thing is that you reach out to them.  I encourage you to reach out to a therapist or a therapist's office counselor.  I wish you the best of luck"
60,My husband cheated on me and it hurt me very bad. It was a time when my health was poor. I'm have a hard time moving on.,"How has your husband acted since then? Was he regretful? How did you find out? Did he confess? These are all things that you want to consider. Betrayal is very hard to get over so if it's taking you awhile to get over, know that this is normal.Hopefully you're husband has been very regretful and upfront and honest with you since this happened. It may take awhile to reestablish your trust with him and he should understand this. It's also very important to discuss WHY he cheated. You want to make sure that the reasoning behind this was not something that could arise again in the future. And if it can, there needs to be an action plan in place (i.e. being honest with how he's feeling) so that you both get a chance to rectify the situation.If the cheating has happened more than once, you may want to reevaluate your reasoning for staying in the marriage. It would be obvious that he did not truly regret what he had done or else he wouldn't repeat the same mistake. However, if it was a single event and he has shown you and continuously shows you that he genuinely loves you and is sorry for his mistake, I would give it a try. People do make mistakes and sometimes it takes an event like this to realize what you have.Know that it takes time and that you have the right to feel what you feel. If the relationship was a good, healthy relationship, it is worth saving. Ease back into it and be upfront with your feelings. In return, your husband should be patient and understanding of this. Also, marriage counselors are often a good go-to as they have a great deal of experience working with marriages in similar situations. Best of luck to you!"," It sounds like you have several things happening at the same time. I would recommend that you focus on the negative thoughts or feelings differently. One thing that I think is helpful is to notice what is happening in your body right now. Is there something you can take immediate to deal with the stress? If you can, try noticing what is happening in your body during any moment of stress, whatever it is. Try to notice what is happening for you so you can understand more what it is that you are feeling. I would also suggest if you are feeling low-breathing, breath taking, stretching, etc try focusing on noticing these things while you breath. Just try to be aware of what you are not so sure of yourself.Also if you notice any tightness in your feet, feel like there is a reason there is something going on. If there is something you can take immediately to start feeling better, such as looking at your feet and looking at your phone. If you can find a therapist quickly what else you can do to help you manage your stress. Remember, you are not a bad person and you certainly don't have to be exactly like you are in person"
61,I need to speak to someone about sexual addiction and binge eating immediately.,"There is an organization dedicated to helping individuals find affordable counseling.  It is called Open Path Collective.  There is a one time membership fee of $49 and it lasts for your lifetime.  You then have access to local counselors/therapists who will see you for an extremely reduced rate, anywhere from $30 - $60.   https://openpathcollective.org/"," Sexual addiction can be a very complex issue.  It is important to remember that a lot of people, if not most, are addicted to and/or victim of sexual abuse or abuse.  It is also important to remember that many sexual addiction symptoms can be related to trauma (sexual abuse as well as emotional abuse.  Remember that emotional abuse can lead to depression and become worse as you get older.  Please seek treatment for yourself if you feel that you are experiencing any of the symptoms you describe here"
62,I need to speak to someone about sexual addiction and binge eating immediately.,There are plenty of online providers within the mental health field that would me more than happy to speak with you immediately.  Many of them provide treatment on a sliding scale fee.  I would google online mental health treatment providers and that should lead you to a list of providers that can help you.," Hi. I'm glad you wrote.  Most of us are addicted to something or someone else's behavior, and it can be really challenging to change if we are not careful.  What you're doing is extraordinary (and I mean *really heroic*!) and it seems to me you've come to the conclusion that we can be quite successfully addicted to pleasure or alcohol consumption to change our behaviors.  You say that you're unaware of how you contribute to the binge drinking. It's possible you consider consumption of more than one drink at a time because alcohol lowers your inhibitions, and thus people who are binge drinkers often already have a drinking habit.  In the long run, careful behavior changes with how you feel about yourself and alcohol consumption. Also, labels are a sneaky way of keeping people accountable. Namely, some longer term things that you did that you regret.  It can be quite difficult to label someone who has a drinking problem, and unfortunately we can do things that we did not like. In the long run, labeling someone can be helpful.  You gave the go ahead to your binge drinking, and since you know that you did what you were doing when you knew you had to stop, then yes, you owe it to your heart to label you a ""binge drinker."" In the long run, labels help us to think through the consequences and how it can help others to think more rationally about their behaviors"
63,I need to speak to someone about sexual addiction and binge eating immediately.,"Depending on your area and location, there may be therapists who provide services on a sliding scale. Additionally, churches will often times offer counseling for free or for a small fee. I suggest doing a simple Google search and contact therapists in your area. It never hurts to ask for a reduced fee and even if he or she is unable to provide the service, they may be able to refer you to someone who can."," Hi Baton Rouge,I'm glad you're reaching out. The first step here is that you are taking some responsibility for your behaviours. I do think it's a good thing you knew what you were getting when you broke your arm and learning how to stop them. I think a lot of people do this behavior, but not everyone does it on their own. Your friend is doing a disservice to their self image by hanging out with this guy. I'm glad you're reaching out. I think you're being selfish. I also think you're a bit unreasonable because you've never tried to stop smoking. I bet there are people who would benefit from some help with this. The only way to stop smoking is to do something about it. Most health conditions that can cause an increase in smoking are linked to physical illness, trauma, drug use, and even death. I've seen many people who try to stop smoking get their daily dose of cigarettes, but if that addiction has reached point where they're not using all the nicotine that much, maybe they can't afford a new one. That said, I have to say, I hear you saying that it might be a good idea to try and quit the cigarettes. That's a great question. The fact that you're reaching out says that there are people who would benefit from some help with this, that's great. I'm sorry that you're struggling. I wish you the best of luck.Robin J.

64,I'm having relationship problems and I want to fix them to make things right before I lose her. How can I learn how to listen and get myself together?,"What an important question, and the fact that you're asking it is a big step in the right direction. To answer in detail would require having quite a bit more information about what ""relationship problems"" have occurred  that woke you up to the fact that you're not listening as well as you could and that you're running the risk of losing her.Given that I don't have all that information, I'll offer one simple suggestion. Your girlfriend is the expert on what she needs and wants in relationship. You could simply say to her that you know you still have a lot to learn about how to have a good relationship and you realize you're not yet understanding what she needs and you really want to. Then take a deep breath, settle down, and listen. Don't argue, don't interrupt, don't judge... listen. Let her know what you understand and that you're open to hearing more, learning more if you're not quite getting it yet... and then listen some more. Be present and curious about this person you love dearly and don't want to lose. This is the first step toward intimacy."," Hi there !  Having a relationship with someone whom you don't like, feels like a tremendous stressor.  It’s very common to have twins if you are planning a relationship.  Thinking that you are going to have a relationship with this whiz is a sign that you are not going to like him.  The person who needs to be aware and aware of their own behavior will always be the person who is going to be the biggest obstacle in your plan.  You can learn to recognize when you are making hurt feelings and take responsibility for your actions toward them.  You can also ask yourself, am I willing to do this for them?  Are you happy with this person and would you like to be in a relationship with her?  Are you and this person okay as a couple?  Many people do not feel comfortable with their partners.  Many couples do not. In answer to your own question, no one is ""okay with their clothes on.""  wear them and don't worry about them.  The most important thing is that you make yourself feel comfortable and comfortable in the relationship.  The more you are willing to spend time with you and make sure that you feel heard and understood, the more comfortable you will become in the relationship.  The more you are willing to put up with what is going on with you, the more comfortable you will become in the relationship.  The more time you and your partner can have together, the more comfortable you will become in becoming comfortable with each other.  The more often you want to see each other as a couple.  The more often you want to see yourself as a couple.  The more often you want to see yourself as a couple.  At least you will know you want to be with your friend"
65,I'm having relationship problems and I want to fix them to make things right before I lose her. How can I learn how to listen and get myself together?,"Hello, and thank you for your question. First, I want to say that it is great that you are are willing to admit that you share some responsibility in some of the relationship problems you are having. This isn't always easy to do, but it sure is important if you want to see improvement. It does sound cliche, but communication really is the bedrock of relationships. And not just intimate partner relationships, but really any relationship that is significant to us. It sounds like you are saying that you have a difficult time really listening to what your partner is telling you and then responding in a way that is helpful. I want to tell you that you are not alone. Good communication skills are not really something you are born with, we actually have to learn them. The good news is that there is great information available to help you do that. Ultimately, some people must seek professional help through couple's counseling in order to get help with this process. This is because some of the hurt and anger could be at such a level already that you may need help setting boundaries, creating a plan, learning new skills, and staying on track. If that is not something you can afford or can do right now, here are a few suggestions that may help. Personally, I am big fan of Dr. John Gottman. He is an expert in relationships and wrote a really great, easy-to-read book called The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work. Dr. Gottman discusses the kind of communication that healthy couples seem to have, which can be helpful and worth trying. You can buy Dr. Gottman's book on Amazon for under $9. It's a good deal. There are a variety of websites that have good information that may help you build your communication. Here is one that I found that has a few good tips. http://www.helpguide.org/articles/relationships/effective-communication.htm You can try them and see if they are helpful. ***It is important to remember that like all new skills, communication requires practice and we surely fail several times before we start getting good at it. If you were ever a pitcher in baseball, then you know you have to throw thousands of pitches before you really start hitting your strike zone consistently. Allow yourself to make mistakes, own them, and start again. I hope these suggestions help, and good luck.Robin Landwehr, DBH, LPCC"," Hi there.

66,I'm having relationship problems and I want to fix them to make things right before I lose her. How can I learn how to listen and get myself together?,"Thanks for your question. Becoming a good listener is an essential piece in being a better communicator. Being an effective communicator will almost always improve the quality of your relationships. What stands in your way of listening to her? Do you find yourself becoming defensive when she brings up issues? Do you often find yourself thinking of what you want to say next? Do you take her words personally, preventing you from having the ability to problem solve?Here are some tips that may help you with being a better listener:1. Concentrate on what you are hearing, not on what you will say next.2. Ask questions if you need clarification or don't understand.3. Summarize what you're hearing after every couple of minutes to make sure that you're not missing anything.4. Ask your partner what she needs from you. Is she expecting advice or does she simply need to vent?5. Keep eye contact and avoid using non-verbal cues that demonstrate defensiveness or irritation such as eye rolling or crossing your arms.6. Remember that it's okay to disagree and, if this is the case, then decide as a team, how you want to move forward.I hope this helps. Good luck to you!"," Hi there.

67,I'm having relationship problems and I want to fix them to make things right before I lose her. How can I learn how to listen and get myself together?,"The best tool for becoming a better listener that I know of is called Imago Dialogue. It consists of 3 steps:1. Mirroring what she says (without judging, commenting, refuting, defending, arguing, or scoffing--just listening, no matter the content) and repeating it back, word-for-word. Continue to ask if she has more to add until she doesn't.2. Validating. You tell her you you understanding why she feels this way. (If you don't understand, then find a way.) You can also say, ""That makes sense"" or ""I hear you"" or ""I get that.""3. Empathizing. Tell her how you think she must feel about what she's telling you. Your job is to try and feel what it feels like to be her.This is a very different way of communicating than we're used to. My guess is that the arguments, discussions, and debates you've had with her have been counterproductive because you're both trying to win. With Imago Dialogue, you both win. She gets to be heard and you get to hear for a change.At the end of the exercise, switch roles.

69,I'm having relationship problems and I want to fix them to make things right before I lose her. How can I learn how to listen and get myself together?,"The first step for making this sort of change is being motivated to change and it sounds like you have that, so you are already on the right track.As far as learning how to listen, try some of these steps:Ask whether a certain time is a good time for your girlfriend to have an important conversationIf she has a subject that she would like to discuss, consider listening to her as an investigative reporter and asking questions that help you to gain more understanding of her experience. These questions usually begin with words like who, what, where, when. Questions starting with the word why can sometimes make people very uncomfortable because they may not explicitly know why they are asking for something or feeling a certain way. You can try communicating this way for just five minutes or so on until you feel as though you can restate what your girlfriend is saying and have her agree that you are recapturing the essence of what she is trying to communicateThen you can switch so she is listening to you trying to understand your experience. You could also start by talking about something that is important to you.Remember that stating that you follow or hear something that she is saying doesn't mean that you agreeAlso, try sticking to one subject at a time. It's difficult to really understand one topic if you are on to the next within just a minute or twoTry to use the word want or wish instead of need. Saying that you need something (or if your girlfriend would say that) that is not a need for safety or something like that can make whatever you are asking for sound like an obligation. That takes away from that whole motivation to change from inside the partner who is agreeing to change or try to changeSomething else to try would be using some sort of timeout. Consider this:Discuss the idea of using timeout before you actually need it and before the discussion starts. Timeout is a way to give each of you a way to calm down for five, 10, 15 minutes, or maybe even an hour. When there are a lot of emotions happening, each person gets wrapped up in protecting themselves from the emotions they are feeling and can lose track of what is actually going on in the conversation as compared to what they are perceiving.When using timeout, say to your girlfriend (or she can say to you) ""I need an hour before we can go back to this."" Then actually come back to the discussion.Some people are very afraid to use this technique because in the past not talking about something right away meant that it never was returned to and was never resolved in any way. This is why the agreement is important before you need it.While it may be helpful to ask your girlfriend what it is she may want from you, it is you that would be in charge of deciding whether you want to make that change and putting it into practice.Try to remember that part of being in a couple is holding onto your own wants, wishes, and desires while recognizing those of your partner.As one final idea, consider spending about 15 minutes a week together where you are not problem-solving about anything, just connecting with one another.I encourage you to see a therapist who specializes in couples if you would like some more specific ideas for what is happening within each of you and between you.Best wishes!"," Hi there. It sounds like you have some history here that you are not happy with. It is important to get this together as a family and put a plan together that you can repeat without her knowing what the other girls feelings are like. You can start by telling her your deepest feelings, not your fondest memories of the time together. Most likely she will be open to understanding your sincere wishes that this be a temporary thing or that you will return to live with her. I think it would be wise for you to seek professional help and support for your relationship. I think you both need to be very aware when you are not - if you are feeling stuck - to simply listen and accept. To also know and accept your feelings, is the best way to move forward. Secondly, make an appointment with a therapist and ask them whatever their recommendation for you are on how to proceed. They can help you decide what is best for you. It is important to make an appointment with the therapist and ask them what they would suggest that you try. This will help you determine what to expect and also allow you to talk with them about the services they offer. Thirdly, make an appointment with the family doctor and ask them what they think and how they are feeling. They can help you make their diagnosis and make a decision about whether it is a good fit. Lastly, make an appointment with the psychologist or psychiatrist. It is important to make appointments with a therapist who is licensed in a given state. It is also important to make sure that you are getting the treatment you need, which includes a basic medical exam and some psychotherapy. Good luck"
70,I'm having relationship problems and I want to fix them to make things right before I lose her. How can I learn how to listen and get myself together?,"Let go of your ego, the ego tends to get in the way of things, be a man and listen, do not react so uch to life around you. life is not out to get you, just listen and work on how your reactive to people and sitations around you. C"," Hi there. It sounds like you have some history here that is really hard to digest. It sounds like you've been in a relationship with a guy for a while now, and the prospect of having a relationship with that guy sounds like a great idea. The first step would be to think about how you would like to be treated in the relationship. Do you want your relationship to be healthy and happy? Do you want to be supportive and courteous? Do you want to know all the details about the relationship? The first step would be to think about the people and things you want to know about yourself. There are no prizes for guessing numbers, and there are no automatic lures that would guarantee you an abusive relationship. You have to think about who you are and why you'd want to hurt them. The second step is to honestly understand the people and the situations that led to your initial attraction to the guy. What made you both male in the first place? What made you both look like a threat? What surprised you when you realized how bad your attraction was? What made you both feel the same way? What is the underlying motivation driving your attraction to the guy? I'll give you some insight into what you're trying to get out of the relationship.1. ""I'm sorry that I made you feel this way. I hoped you would understand.""Many people who are involved in sex and relationship issues, will tell you that their first thought is to walk away, but they're not going to jail. They are not going to think twice about doing something they hate. So, they will actually do it again, because doing so will make their lives better. They will be less likely to do it when they are unable to talk about things they are doing. What this means is if you are unable to leave the relationship because you are not willing to leave the relationship, then you have to honestly understand the people and why you are attracted to him. 2. ""I cannot imagine how unacceptable it is for you to be asking myself how I am worthy of being in a relationship. Perhaps you can ask yourself how you are a human being and consider taking a look at the behaviors you describe as indicative of a problem in the relationship. If you can, try to separate the behaviors from the feeling in order to come to a conclusion on a clearer base what might be happening. This way you have a clearer base for judging the validity of the relationship. 3. ""I cannot imagine how unacceptable it is for me to be asking myself how I am worthy of being in a relationship. Perhaps you can try some self-exploration. I am not a hugger, and I sometimes am not very honest with myself. I want to know more about who I am. If you hug me and tell me you want to know more, that's cool. The best self-exploration is when you both identify with the idea that this is what you want to know, that it's the way you want to be seen, heard, understood and understood. These three things can happen in the first, second and third try at it, but it can change over time. It can't happen before you've been together for two years. If you are concerned that your feelings are coming apart, it may be a sign that things are not as good between you. If this is still a big issue for you, talking to someone who can help you resolve this issue can be a great idea"
71,I'm having relationship problems and I want to fix them to make things right before I lose her. How can I learn how to listen and get myself together?,"I'm glad to read about your willingness to develop new ways to invest yourself with your partner.The easier way to fix a relationship is when both people are helped to recognize the ways the couple dynamic falls short of what each person would like.Couples therapy is exactly this.Still, relationships can change if one person changes since changing one part of a system will change the system itself.Besides starting to work with a therapist on what you can do differently, reflect within yourself on the situations when problems arise between the two of you.See if you can figure out what you wanted and what you partner wanted in that particular moment. Was one of you trying to help the other and the person felt insulted by the suggestion of needing help?This is only an example of how intentions are misread or not welcome by one partner from the other.Also keep in mind there is a limit to everyone's flexibility.Reflecting and self-awareness are the first step.The second step is to know when you've reached the end of possibilities to change yourself and not be accepted for who you are.This raises the question of whether the two of you are far apart in similarities in order to be happy together.Good luck in enjoying the changes you will try to make!"," Hi there !  Having a relationship with someone whom you can't understand one another, is never easy. There are some who feel like they are always in love, and some that they are only a couple. There are people who know best and others that they do not. You are newly married, and you're in a relationship with your ex-partner.  There are probably people in your life that are as interested in your new relationship as you are in her.  You and your ex are both happy for her and want to make her happy, just try to do the best you can. I guess anyone can say that there are no ""no's"" in a relationship?  You and your ex are both happy people involved.  What do you need help in the long run ? Can you find another way to be happy ? I suggest you find a counselor who has experience in relationship and sexuality issues. Another option is to seek one local counselor. I wish you the best "
72,I'm having relationship problems and I want to fix them to make things right before I lose her. How can I learn how to listen and get myself together?,"Hard to say a whole lot without knowing more. However, if you focus your attention on her, what she's saying, what she's feeling instead of trying to make yourself heard and understood first, that's often a good step. Also, work on building win-win agreements with her, and follow through on them. Those are the areas I see men fall short on most often. Hope that helps!"," Hi there. It sounds like you have already given yourself some time to accept the fact that you are with someone who is not your boyfriend. After all, you're already married and you're already married. What would you suggest that's causing you to keep asking yourself this question? If there's something that I can get you started on, please feel free. I'd also encourage you to reach out to a local therapist for evaluation and can provide more specific resources as needed"
73,"Whenever I sing along with a song that I like (even if it's just for the beat and not the lyrics), my boyfriend assumes that the words of the song mean something negative about our realationship.    I don't why he gets so mad and assumes I mean something negative from every song. Now I can't enjoy and sing a song without him thinking I'm trying to give him a hint. He even accuses me of cheating and lying. It's driving me nuts. I love him and would never do such an awful thing ever. How can I get him to understand?","Well, have you told him similar descriptions of your feelings as you just wrote here?This will give him the same understanding you're allowing us to have here on this site.Keep in mind that the best, the amount and the number of times you tell your boyfriend some information about you, still means that whether or not he is willing to accept and rely on your information, is in his hands only.Try to feel satisfied with your own effort to explain yourself.   Another path to open is to ask your boyfriend his reason to feel insecure about your love for him.  This may open a wider discussion about what he feels he'd like from you so he feels good in the relationship.", Sing along as well as you would like to see the song changed.Maybe if you're in a group with a female lead the two of you will listen to the suggestions and not the other way around.If the two of you are having fun with it and the problem is with the songwriting it will be a separate and more natural way to approach the problem.  If he wrote the song and the problem is with the writing the problem is not writing the problem.  If he doesn't write the problem write about your feelings about whether or not the problem is writing itself.  You may try a different approach and see if that works best for him
74,Me and the father of my child have been dating for a year. We had a big argument and at first he wanted to work it out. But with time he started asking others and they told him to leave me. Now he wants me to wait on him to mature. He wants to talk to other people. Then come back in four years. He doesn't want to deal with me while I'm pregnant. He doesn't take me to the doctor or anything. I feel alone. How do I handle this situation?,"Well, as far as your boyfriend, sounds like he has received advice from others that is not wise advice.  Leaving is not the answer after a ""big argument"" as you mentioned.  However this is not surprising to me based on his possible age and maturity level.  Having a baby is a lifetime responsibility and there are very few who handle this or who realizes that it requires one to step their game up.  This is something that he has to realize and be encouraged by his parents or a mature adult to do.  Hopefully, someone who has better (wise) advice will talk to him and he will listen.As for you,  how do you handle this situation is your question....you do what you have to do to prepare for your baby, with or without him.  A lot can happen in four years and you don't have time, are not required, and can't wait to see what will happen with him.  You have a LIFE to prepare for,  to feed, to protect, and to love.  Can you tell your baby to wait; I don't want to deal with you now; I need to mature; I will be back to see you later; Hope you will be fine?  Nope!!!   As I always say, you are not alone because there is someone somewhere going through the same or similar thing.  Develop healthy friendships...whether with family, friends or new people who may enter your life.  Your support system will grow and life will go on...with or with him.  Stay focus on you and your baby..."," I would suggest some couples counseling. You can request counseling at any trauma clinic in the area. You can request couples counseling through the National Crisis Hotline. You can seek counseling through survivors of the sexual abuse of any kind. You can seek counseling through the Military Police or the Military Sheriff's Office. You can seek counseling through referral to a local mental health agency.I don't know what you mean when you say you want to work it out between you and your ex, but perhaps in not working out over time, you will discover some new ways of handling conflict. Either with friends or with a therapist, of course. I wonder if you will be more open to someone who is trained in couples therapy or perhaps with a therapist. The price of doing couples therapy? A lot of what you are describing here may be obtained from friends or with a therapist.The military may make the procedure more difficult for you. Perhaps you can request that the service member who is making the decision to end the relationship inform you of the process that is taking place. Perhaps you can ask the person for a moment to describe the emotion that is being expressed to you. Perhaps you can ask the person if they are able to continue in that conversation. When it is time to talk, I like to use the time to ask the person if they are able to continue in that discussion. If the answer is yes, then continue. When the person doesn't say yes, I like to suggest you take a break and restate that what you are experiencing is her emotion. I don't know how long that will be for you in your life. If it is during this time, take a moment to see if you can repeat what she is saying and if she is willing to talk. Check in with her daily routine and if anything, she may want to break up with you. If she is still willing, I would recommend that you let her know how you feel and give you a few things to think about. This may help the relationship to improve. I know this may not be the best thing for you, but it makes you feel better"
75,"I have been dating my boyfriend for a month, and we want a baby. We don't work or drive, and we haven't talked to our parents. What should we do?","Hi Athens, When a teenager wants to have a baby, it's usually for a specific, and not healthy, reason. Do you maybe hope that a baby will cement your relationship? It doesn't work that way. Do you yearn for a person who will love you deeply? Babies don't give to us; we give endlessly to them. I urge you to talk to someone you trust about why you want to speed up your life by being a parent before you are fully grown emotionally. A relationship that is one month old is not stable enough to support a change like this. You're only starting to get to know each other. I wish you well and hope you talk to someone."," Hi! It sounds like you're in a tough spot.You're definitely in the same position of not going anywhere with you parenting. Not only are your children not going to be able to pay for your care, but they likely won't be able to pay for your care at all. And that can lead to problems.Are you and your boyfriend able to talk about the details of your relationship? If you want, you can ask them for details too. It's safe to say that their mom will be interested in talking with you. It also says that if you are interested, you should ask for their agreement. The key thing to remember here is that what you say to her doesn't mean what she wants or wants him to do. What she is saying is ""I want us to still be together and I want us to not argue anymore. I told him what I said to him and he said ""No."" I'm sure he'll just have ""no luck."" That doesn't give her the right to penalize you for anything. Would you want your boyfriend to do that? That's what you'd have to do to make that right? That's what your boyfriend is doing. And again, I'm sure your mom wants him to do that. I get the feeling that you don't want to hear this. The important thing to remember is that what you say to her doesn't mean what she is thinking is okay. And if she is thinking she's not thinking herself then that's a cue to do some soul searching. Talk to her about your feelings. Tell her what you don't like about her. If she's not sure then you might want to try to talk about that too. You can also check in with her about your boyfriend's feelings. I'm not sure if you're asking her questions or if you're just not sure. But if there is a part of you that is willing to talk, then that's a good time to have a conversation and then see how you two feel about that as you sort through this whole thing. .'s/No. I think the most important thing is that you couple is trust. Ask for what you want and see what she wants. If she doesn't want anything on her own, that's her choice. If she wants anything, it's her doing. A lot of the fears that you're feeling are completely reasonable. Fear is a symptom of abuse. Abuse is telling other people what is inside of you. It is not a person you can just cut out. You can say ""I'm not a c*** anymore, and I don't care about you."" or ""You're so scared of me."" and then say ""You're a c***. You're a c***. You're a c***. Let's stop c***ing now."" It is a cry from a child. No one wants to hear that from a parent. There is a reason why parents are able to end parental relationships. It is as if someone was sliding into a pit of boiling water. If the child is aware of this, they will not be able to pull away. The problem is that children don't know how to pull away when they are feeling pushed away by traumatic events. They just know to stay calm, and that is the first step in learning and expressing their emotions. A therapist can help the child learn assertive communication skills, boundary violations, handling of hurtful boundary lines, and maintaining a safe environment. There is no cost to attending counseling. You can request a therapist from the therapist, but it is highly recommended that youaster first. Dr. Virginia Chowwww.psychologyresource.c"
76,"My fiancé doesn't think I trust him because I was cheated on before. However, he hides his phone and has been texting his ex-girlfriend, who he has two kids with. What should I do?","Oh Chino, I only have half the picture here so I will be cautious. There's a chicken and an egg, and I don't know which came first. One thing I see clearly is that your fiance will always have to have communications with his ex, because they have children. Can you accept that? When suspicion and insecurity come along, your job is to look at the big picture and the real picture. Is there any real evidence that he is cheating? Remember that texting his ex is not evidence alone if the communications are about the kids. Has he earned your trust? If so, then it's not fair to punish him for the betrayals of others. He's not your ex. Reassure your heart that you are his priority if the larger evidence supports that. At the same time, you can let him know what your triggers are. For example, hiding his phone doesn't send you a good message, right? See, this is the chicken and the egg...is he hiding the phone because you've been overreacting when he gets a text?  So let him know you won't blow up about him getting a text if he doesn't conceal or password his phone. Transparency helps build trust. You have sensitivities, and it helps you a lot if he's aware of them and willing to try not to do things that trigger fear. Let him know when you get scared, and hopefully he'll give you the openness and security you need in order to trust him and act as if you trust him.  :)", I'm so sorry.. I feel like you did the biggest insecurities of your life. I can't imagine how awful this must have been for you. I also can't imagine how protective you are of yourself at this terrible time. reassure yourself that you love you and that you're okay. Also think of other things you did that didn't involve him. Consider doing something that feels supportive of yourself. You're not supposed to have this kind of relationship with a partner
77,"My boyfriend says I'm nuts. I need to get help because I get an overwhelming feeling that he is cheating on me. Whenever I try to talk with him about it, he always turns it around on me by telling me what I'm doing wrong. I know that accusing him does not help. When his whole demeanor shifts towards me, I can't help but think that something is wrong. Am I wrong for feeling this way? I try to talk with him to make it better. I let him know when I am feeling down. But I am not confident in these things.  Two weeks ago a girl texted his phone 3 times trying to hook up with him. He texted her back with ""Sorry, I've been working. I just read your message."" The girl was trying to get him to call her at a time when he was at home with me. He texted her back with ""Don't text me anymore."" I don't feel like I am way out of the line. But I can't talk with him if all that he will say is that I'm crazy and I need help. What should I do? How will I go about checking if there really is something wrong with me?","Trust your intuition that your boyfriend is involved with other people.You gave examples which strongly suggest this.Quite commonly, a person twist someone's words to convince then of having problems in seeing or understanding their own and other's behavior.Your intuition is again working quite well in telling you that your problem is having a boyfriend who manipulates you, not that you're seeing things incorrectly.One way to check if you're totally misreading him, is to examine whether you feel similarly in other relationships.If no one else who knows you tells you that you're crazy, then this strongly points to your boyfriend twisting words so that you feel wrong.Also, a consult with a therapist would clarify the dynamics between you and your boyfriend.A therapist session would also allow you to think out loud in a confidential discussion, what to do with your newfound clarity!"," This is so very common. Questions/consequences are a healthy way to discuss an issue.  Usually the person has a general idea of what is going on.  Sometimes there is a prelude to a more serious problem.  I would suggest talking about what escalated between you and your boyfriend (or, more likely, your parents).  Both of you could re-direct your questions about your having problems with ""faulty"" communication.  Communication is important and not every issue can be addressed in one session.  Seek counseling to process the verbal and the emotional.  If possible, counseling will also help you to form more firm plans and strategies to show up on once your problems have been resolved"
78,Why am I attracted to older men?,"What a wonderful question!Good for you on clearly knowing your priorities.If I was sitting with you now, I'd ask you to list your reasons.Start with whatever answers you do come up with and examine each of these a little further.If, for example, you feel you need a man because many of your friends are in relationships, then possibly you feel insecure about being your unique self, even when this sets you apart from your friends.If, you feel you need a man to protect you financially, then possibly you've lost faith in your ability to financially support yourself.If you'd like a man in your life to offer your love and are willing to contribute the work of relating intimately, then you've found the best reason for wanting a man in your life.This is far different than ""need""."," There are many possible reasons for why you are drawn to older men.  Some may be quite significant and some are just as important as what you may just recently been thinking about.  You may be thinking of men who are now your friends.  This may happen several generations down the road when men no longer fear toision our opinions and actions.  It may be a good idea to have a discussion and determine the reasons for this choice with a trusted friend or therapist.  Remember the following:Never be too old to understand what's going on.  Be persistent and affirm that you are not drawn to men who are too young to understand.  Be persistent and affirm that you are not ""making mistakes.""  Measure your possible benefit to you from the intervention of doing some active things for yourself and your relationship.  If you have confidence in this, then definitely tell your partner.  You can think of your relationship as being an organizer.  Think about what you like and what you don't like about your partner.  What is it about the relationship that makes you want to be a better person.  The plan is to be both transparent and mutually supportive of each other.  Expect to make some changes and learn from them.  Don't judge your partner's point of view.  Don't judge their choices.  Make decisions based on the truth.  Be consistent in your love and acceptance of how they may define you.  Don't expect them to exactly ""next time"" do what is right for you.  Don't give them a hard time about ""how they"" are handling themselves.  Be the man or woman you want to be with"
79,I've gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime I walk in I get nervous and shaky. Is this normal? Should I still be feeling like this?,"Hello.

If you are not comfortable discussing this with your therapist, this may be something to take into consideration and worthy of thinking about: why you are not comfortable speaking to the therapist. I understand this is difficult. If I may offer one more suggestion, breathing exercises are very beneficial. Remind yourself what you are working to achieve, close your eyes in a safe moment and breathe in and out slowly, in slowly through your nose and out through your mouth with pursed lips. Breathe in for approximately 5-10 seconds, then let it out slowly. Be sure and do this when you are in private, and feel safe environment. When you begin, I suggest putting your hand on your stomach, over your belly button to feel yourself actually taking in those deep breaths.

If you are not comfortable discussing this with your therapist, this may be something to take into consideration and worthy of thinking about: why you are not comfortable speaking to the therapist. I understand this is difficult. If I may offer one more suggestion, breathing exercises are very beneficial. Remind yourself what you are working to achieve, close your eyes in a safe moment and breathe in and out slowly, in slowly through your nose and out through your mouth with pursed lips. Breathe in for approximately 5-10 seconds, then let it out slowly. Be sure and do this when you are in private, and feel safe environment. When you begin, I suggest putting your hand on your stomach, over your belly button to feel yourself actually taking in those deep breaths. I know it may sound kind of silly but they really work and are incredibly helpful. We often forget to breathe, especially when we  are feeling anxious. You are supported here and try taking yourself through the above thought process and breathing and practice the breathing several times a day. I hope this shaky and uneasy feeling eases.

81,I've gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime I walk in I get nervous and shaky. Is this normal? Should I still be feeling like this?,"If you have only been to a couple of sessions, it makes sense that you might still feel apprehensive at first. Therapy is hard work! You may be talking about some things that you never talked to anyone about before. Opening up to stranger can be scary. After you feel comfortable with your counselor, and trust has built up and you feel understood in session, you should feel more relaxed. I would encourage you to talk to your counselor about feeling a little shaky. Sharing what the process is like for you is important in your work. If you still feel unsure about sharing after several sessions, it is important to take a look at that and try to understand where that may be coming from. For example, are you and the therapist not a good fit? But, again if you are just starting out in working together, feeling a little bit nervous makes perfect sense, and I encourage you to give it a bit more time and to talk to your therapist about how you are feeling."," Well, it's generally okay to feel anxious or nervous about going to therapy, particularly in the beginning because the process of being open about what you are going through, much less to someone who you don't know well, can be anxiety-producing. It's also common to feel anxious when you are discussing something that is important, difficult to discuss, or you are making changes that are very difficult for you.The most important thing I can tell you, though, is to discuss with your therapist this idea that you feel nervous and shaky. Some anxiety can actually help to motivate or lead you toward change. There are also level of anxiety that can be counterproductive, so it's a good thing to discuss. Personally, I can tell you that I would want my clients to tell me about anxiety they feel 100% of the time. That opens the dialog to discuss whether it is the level of anxiety that they want to sit with and learn about in discovering more about themselves and their experiences and/or whether they would like to do something to lessen the feeling of anxiety.Thanks for writing here. If it caused anxiety for you to do so, I hope that feeling is diminishing for you, at least related to writing here"
82,I've gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime I walk in I get nervous and shaky. Is this normal? Should I still be feeling like this?,"Hi there, Thank you for your question. It's absolutely ok to feel nervous going to therapy. I have experienced anxiety going to see my own therapist. There can be a few reasons why you might feel this way. First, it is always unnerving to see a person who is a stranger and to share intimate things with that stranger. You mentioned it has only been a couple of sessions. Your anxiety might subside as you continue to see your therapist and grow more comfortable with him/her. Another reason why you might feel particularly nervous is perhaps you are not comfortable sharing things. As children, we might have bad experiences opening up to others. Someone might bully or ridicule us, and that experience can stay with us for a long time, making it extra scary to share our intimate feelings and thoughts with others. If this the case, as you continue with your sessions and have positive interactions with your therapists, this anxiety will subside with time and you will re-learn that it is safe to share. And the last thought why you might feel the shakes is perhaps you know that you need to talk about some past experiences or memories that are uncomfortable and difficult. Regardless of the reason, it might help you to bring up your nervousness in your session and share how you feel with your therapist. Having an open dialogue about your anxiety with your therapist can help you resolve some of that anxiety and built greater trust with your therapist."," Hello.

83,I've gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime I walk in I get nervous and shaky. Is this normal? Should I still be feeling like this?,"Thank you for your question. It's completely normal and natural to feel nervous before a therapy session. Many people report having felt this way. I can't say enough regarding the amount of courage it takes to reach out and attend a therapy session. For many people, it can take weeks, months, or even years of contemplating whether to see a therapist or not before actually contacting one and attending the first session. It takes courage to want to work through any struggles you may be having or personal growth you aspire toward. In your question, you mentioned that you've ""gone several times and are still feeling nervous and shaky."" If you feel comfortable with your therapist and it's a good fit for you, I would suggest talking about this with your therapist. You don't have to struggle each time you have your appointment.

87,I've gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime I walk in I get nervous and shaky. Is this normal? Should I still be feeling like this?,"It depends on your definition of ""normal""!:) I would say that the average client I see feels some level of nervous energy when they come into their sessions, and especially at the beginning. I think that with clients who I work with that have difficult times in relationships, maybe being able to trust people is tougher for them given their life experiences, the expectation would be that they have a harder time moving through those nerves and feeling more at peace in sessions.In my opinion, a competent therapist could help you explore where these nerves are actually coming from (talking about yourself, relating to another, something else?) I encourage all of my clients to bring up whatever emotions are coming up for them in the moment, as it's helpful to the client to recognize the ""present moment"" emotion and then being able to process, learn from, and move through to a more peaceful place, if that is what is being sought."," Hello.

91,I've gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime I walk in I get nervous and shaky. Is this normal? Should I still be feeling like this?,"Yes, feeling nervous for the first few or several sessions of therapy, is completely normal.Therapy is an unusual way to have a conversation with someone.   The person is an expert in recognizing and understanding dynamics of human interactions.   For some people the fear is that the therapist knows more about you than you do yourself.In general terms hopefully your therapist has worked with many other people who've faced problems similar to yours.In this sense the therapist has a general idea of the basic dynamics you most likely are handling.No therapist could possibly know your particular details and your particular areas of upset or in what ways you feel unsure of yourself.Once you start to trust both your own right to tell your particular story and start to also feel that your therapist is listening attentively and cares what you tell the person, your nervousness will start to disappear all on its own.Good luck in getting the most from your therapy sessions!"," Well, it's generally okay to feel anxious or nervous about going to therapy, particularly in the beginning because the process of being open about what you are going through, much less to someone who you don't know well, can be anxiety-producing. It's also common to feel anxious when you are discussing something that is important, difficult to discuss, or you are making changes that are very difficult for you.The most important thing I can tell you, though, is to discuss with your therapist this idea that you feel nervous and shaky. Some anxiety can actually help to motivate or lead you toward change. There are also level of anxiety that can be counterproductive, so it's a good thing to discuss. Personally, I can tell you that I would want my clients to tell me about anxiety they feel 100% of the time. That opens the dialog to discuss whether it is the level of anxiety that they want to sit with and learn about in discovering more about themselves and their experiences and/or whether they would like to do something to lessen the feeling of anxiety.Thanks for writing here.

Should I still be feeling like this?,"It is absolutely normal to be nervous about therapy.  Many people take years to make the decision to start counseling and although it is a safe place to explore feelings, it may be the first time you are facing certain issues.  It takes courage to face issues head on.  Being nervous is part of the process.  The fact that you are continuing to go to therapy sessions despite feeling nervous demonstrates your strength.  Keep it up!"," Hello. First, I am so sorry you are experiencing these feelings. They can be intense, I will do my best to offer some suggestions or thoughts that I hope will be helpful to you. There could be a number of things occurring. Therapy is a delicate, private decision and I would first like to commend you for the fact that you are not giving up, that you are working to figure this out, and make this work, it sounds like you are engaged and motivated to receive support from a professional, your continued  dedication and motivation will take you far. I would first start by asking if you have discussed this with your therapist, if you feel comfortable enough telling your therapist what is going on, maybe inform the therapist that  that you feel nervous and shaky. I am a firm believer in open communication between the client and therapist as this builds a healthy therapeutic relationship that yields positive outcomes, if this can be obtained and well received. This is YOUR time for healing and therapy should be a safe, supportive environment to not only process but to seek support and guidance from a professional who can help you move past the barriers. If you feel you are comfortable and able to speak to your therapist, that would be my first suggestion, is to tell he or she how you are feeling. If they know then they can help determine the potential cause and allow you to process and move forward. If this is left un resolved it will be hard for you to move forward. If you are not comfortable discussing this with your therapist, this may be something to take into consideration and worthy of thinking about: why you are not comfortable speaking to the therapist. I understand this is difficult. If I may offer one more suggestion, breathing exercises are very beneficial. Remind yourself what you are working to achieve, close your eyes in a safe moment and breathe in and out slowly, in slowly through your nose and out through your mouth with pursed lips. Breathe in for approximately 5-10 seconds, then let it out slowly. Be sure and do this when you are in private, and feel safe environment. When you begin, I suggest putting your hand on your stomach, over your belly button to feel yourself actually taking in those deep breaths. I know it may sound kind of silly but they really work and are incredibly helpful. We often forget to breathe, especially when we  are feeling anxious. You are supported here and try taking yourself through the above thought process and breathing and practice the breathing several times a day. I hope this shaky and uneasy feeling eases.

93,I've gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime I walk in I get nervous and shaky. Is this normal?

This therapy thing your doing is sometimes scary. First, because your opening up things that you might have never wanted to. Second, your still building a relationship with this therapist person. You may never get over that. The therapist really can't be your ""friend"". They are there to push the buttons that you might not want pushed and help you heal.  That in itself is scary and can make you anxious. Third, you really never know where this therapy thing will go.

100,I've gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime I walk in I get nervous and shaky. Is this normal? Should I still be feeling like this?,"Hello there.  You ask about being nervous and shaky walking in to your therapy session and want to know if its normal? ...  I realize there a few ways to look at this.  I presume you weren't anticipating feeling this way; and probably hoped to feel the opposite..  Well, my initial response is yes, sure, it can be within reason to feel this way.  Have you been in therapy before? Is this somewhat new? That could be part of the reason. But either way; new or not, I think when are entering into a meeting that holds potential evaluation of deep things about you and your heart and soul, it can cause anyone to tremble. The soul can be anticipating some things could be shaken up here, and it can feel scary to look at these things and then change.  Looking deep at our life can feel daunting and scary; so your response just might be regards to potential growth trying to happen.   OR, is there something about the therapist you don't feel confident about?  This too might be in play as a reason for your feelings...  Maybe you lack confidence in that therapist ?  Have you let your therapist know how you feel?  That would be good to explore...I would like to encourage you to look at these ideas.  Hope it helps.   Let me knowKindly,keithkeithcounseling.com"," Hello.

Should I still be feeling like this?,"Everyone has different experiences going to therapy. Being nervous can be a typical emotion one might feel. Emotions are our body's way of telling us important information about ourselves. I would suggest talking openly in your sessions about this. That way you can process your thoughts and feelings with the guidance of your counselor. There are probably underlining emotions (fears or insecurities) that are being stirred up during your therapy sessions. Your counselor might suggest individual counseling depending on what you learn about your anxiety. In individual therapy you would have time to deal with your own stressors. As you address your issues, then you will have tools and skills that will be useful in addressing the couple relationship."," Well, it's generally okay to feel anxious or nervous about going to therapy, particularly in the beginning because the process of being open about what you are going through, much less to someone who you don't know well, can be anxiety-producing.

Therapy can be a rewarding process, however often times we do not pay much attention to the messages being sent to our bodies.

104,I've gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime I walk in I get nervous and shaky. Is this normal? Should I still be feeling like this?,"It is totally normal - you have a lot riding on this and you're invested! Think about why you feel so shaky - is it something about the therapist or their style? If so, it would be a good idea to talk with them about it so you feel more at ease. In any case bringing up your feelings about therapy in therapy is totally appropriate and even necessary. Good luck!"," Hello. First, I am so sorry you are experiencing these feelings. They can be intense, I will do my best to offer some suggestions or thoughts that I hope will be helpful to you. There could be a number of things occurring. Therapy is a delicate, private decision and I would first like to commend you for the fact that you are not giving up, that you are working to figure this out, and make this work, it sounds like you are engaged and motivated to receive support from a professional, your continued  dedication and motivation will take you far. I would first start by asking if you have discussed this with your therapist, if you feel comfortable enough telling your therapist what is going on, maybe inform the therapist that  that you feel nervous and shaky. I am a firm believer in open communication between the client and therapist as this builds a healthy therapeutic relationship that yields positive outcomes, if this can be obtained and well received. This is YOUR time for healing and therapy should be a safe, supportive environment to not only process but to seek support and guidance from a professional who can help you move past the barriers. If you feel you are comfortable and able to speak to your therapist, that would be my first suggestion, is to tell he or she how you are feeling. If they know then they can help determine the potential cause and allow you to process and move forward. If this is left un resolved it will be hard for you to move forward. If you are not comfortable discussing this with your therapist, this may be something to take into consideration and worthy of thinking about: why you are not comfortable speaking to the therapist. I understand this is difficult. If I may offer one more suggestion, breathing exercises are very beneficial. Remind yourself what you are working to achieve, close your eyes in a safe moment and breathe in and out slowly, in slowly through your nose and out through your mouth with pursed lips. Breathe in for approximately 5-10 seconds, then let it out slowly. Be sure and do this when you are in private, and feel safe environment. When you begin, I suggest putting your hand on your stomach, over your belly button to feel yourself actually taking in those deep breaths. I know it may sound kind of silly but they really work and are incredibly helpful. We often forget to breathe, especially when we  are feeling anxious. You are supported here and try taking yourself through the above thought process and breathing and practice the breathing several times a day. I hope this shaky and uneasy feeling eases.

105,"I start counseling/therapy in a few days (I'm freaking out) but my main fear is that I'll cry and embarrass myself, is it something to worry about?","Oh, crying in therapy is very normal! I have a stack of kleenex boxes in my office. Cry away, therapist are very used to it:) First time being in therapy is scary, but you'll soon know if you are a good match."," Hi, Counseling can be very nerve-wracking. And, it takes courage to reach out for help. My question for you is, what would you tell your mom if she was experiencing anxiety? Would you say, ""Mom, I want to help and I know you want to help me, but I'm afraid that I won't be able to."" What would you tell your daughter if she told you whether or not she wanted to help or not? Crying is a tender and vulnerable part of the heart's desire to protect us.  When that is not possible, it can highlight other, more troubled feelings.I encourage you to also text your daughter and ask for some help, understanding that she needs to be able to answer that kind of question with a healthy amount of emotion.  Be prepared that she will be willing to provide you with more information.  And, if she refuses, share more of your feelings with her.  And both of you will feel greater self-esteem and more confident in your abilities.  Best of luck to you"
106,"I start counseling/therapy in a few days (I'm freaking out) but my main fear is that I'll cry and embarrass myself, is it something to worry about?","People do cry in therapy sometimes, but it's not at all necessary to cry in order for most kinds of therapy to be helpful. When you start counseling you don't yet know your counselor very well, so it's normal to keep your feelings in check until you feel comfortable and a bit more relaxed with your counselor and with the situation. Sometimes, though, there are emotions that have been waiting and waiting to finally find someone who will listen with a kind ear. If you feel safe right away in the situation with your counselor, you might just cry in spite of your fears about it. Your therapist is used to people expressing how they feel and will keep strict confidentiality, so even though it's embarrassing, finally experiencing someone truly listening with empathy and kindness may just be worth it. It's okay too to let your counselor know right at the beginning that you're kind of freaked out about getting too emotional in front of another person."," Hi, Counseling can be very nerve-wracking. I have to commend you for reaching out. You have taken the first and necessary step in helping those in your path. Mindfulness based practices like cognitive reframing and progressive acceptance have been shown to be very effective in treating many different forms of anxiety. You can do this. I recommend Bessel van der Kolk's book on why he would want to do therapy. In it, she writes a lot about her life changes after therapy session. I highly recommend it.  It's a great book"
107,"I start counseling/therapy in a few days (I'm freaking out) but my main fear is that I'll cry and embarrass myself, is it something to worry about?","Crying is a natural process when you talk about upsetting things especially in therapy when you are opening up and being so vulnerable. I suggest that you consider how you would feel/respond to someone that was confiding to you and they began to cry. If you felt concerned, supportive and empathetic then you know exactly how us therapists feel when our clients are emotional in sessions. I suggest that you think of times where you have cried and how you felt at that time in public and what would have helped to make you feel less uncomfortable during your tears. I think of crying like any other natural reaction of our body such as sneezing, laughing, coughing. You can't help but do those things and most people won't really judge negatively if you do it in public. Similarly, crying is our body's reaction when we are emotional whether it is tears of joy, from a hilarious joke or from being upset. If you are very uncomfortable about crying but willing to start therapy perhaps you can ask the therapist if you can turn your chair around if you begin crying. This way you are not facing them and can self soothe without worrying about how you physically look at that time.I wish you luck and you should be proud of yourself for starting therapy and I wish you a wonderful journey on this important path that you are embarking on.", Many people cry during their therapy sessions. Actually most people cry in their therapist's office. I tell my clients that it's safe to cry in my office and crying isn't a sign of weakness. It's a normal human response to pain. People actually do more harm to themselves by trying not to cry than by crying. Crying is very cleansing and an important part of the healing process for many people
108,"I start counseling/therapy in a few days (I'm freaking out) but my main fear is that I'll cry and embarrass myself, is it something to worry about?",It is not uncommon to be a bit nervous meeting your therapist (or another person) for the first time. Your therapist understands that calling and getting an appointment was a big step for you and will do their best to put you at ease. Providing a safe environment for our clients includes not judging them and being comfortable with the information and emotions that they share with us. It is ok to cry and to trust that the therapist will honor this as part of your process.," Hi, Counseling can be a very rewarding hobby. Here are a few reasons for that: Great communication is essential for successful relationships. One thing to keep in mind is that talking yourself out of shame is a healthy approach. I would say that you are about to be held accountable for yourself and your behaviors. You can remind yourself that you're being genuine to yourself and to you about the time you'd like to spend with you friend. The behavior of the therapist is completely separate from the person's life. For example, you could ask them to show you how you're handling yourself, how you're feeling in your life, etc. These details matter very much to the success or failure of the therapy. The therapist should be able to give you feedback about your therapy process and what you need from a therapist. It's a safe place to be to have some ideas and to discuss your questions. The therapist should be able to challenge you enough to know that the work you're doing is safe and sound. If the therapist isn't able to do this, that's a good sign you're in a safe place. Some therapist's can and will make that very clear in their communications. You're not a bad therapist - most people don't think of themselves as very good or at least not very good at therapy. Most don't think of themselves as very good at therapy. Most do not think of themselves as very bad. Most think of themselves as very good at therapy. If you want to explore the reasons for that concern, read about three parts of this question. Part 1: What are the reasons for the therapist's lack of effectiveness at therapy?Part 2: How does a person decide if he or she is a good fit for me?Part 3: How does a person decide if he or she is a good fit for me?If a therapist is unable to give a good answer to your question and the therapist has good communication with you, then you're looking at part of the trap that you are already aware and aware of how the person sees you. Part 1: What are the reasons for the therapist's lack of effectiveness at therapy?Part 2: What are the reasons for the therapist's lack of effectiveness at therapy?If a therapist is able to give you a clear answer to your question and the thing that you are about to discuss, then you've reached the goal of the therapist.Part 3: What are the characteristics of the person the therapist is assuming to work with?If a therapist is unable to give a good answer to your question and the person is a good match for the therapist, then you've reached the goal of the therapist"
109,"I start counseling/therapy in a few days (I'm freaking out) but my main fear is that I'll cry and embarrass myself, is it something to worry about?","Yes, if crying is how you are expressing an emotion, then not only would it be normal, but hopefully encouraged, because it's an important part of therapy to have a safe space to express your emotions. We might encourage you to put words to the tears as well, to help you expand on your experience and begin to make more sense of it.As a therapist, our job is help you open up and feel comfortable enough doing so. I sincerely hope no therapist would ever shame you for whatever experience you are having in the room.", Many people cry during their therapy sessions.

110,"I start counseling/therapy in a few days (I'm freaking out) but my main fear is that I'll cry and embarrass myself, is it something to worry about?","It is is absolutely normal to cry in therapy. I can understand wanting to keep everything together and put your best foot forward with everyone you come into contact with, but it can be such a powerful experience to cry with somebody that can hear you and accept you. It's so brave of you to go and share yourself with your counselor! I hope you will keep being brave as you begin healing."," Hi there !  As someone who has practiced as a clinical psychologist for 25 years , I would say that crying is NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT AT ALL ! Almost every single person I have worked with has cried at one point or another.  Starting therapy takes a lot of courage; when you work with a therapist ,once you feel safe ,  you talk about a lot of very private and potentially emotional things that you may have never discussed with anyone before.  I have seen  people cry with sadness , cry with relief at releasing painful things they have held onto for a long time, cry because they feel so relieved that they finally feel heard.   I myself have sometimes cried with clients because some things they talk about are so profoundly moving.   I can assure you that most , if not all , therapists expect clients to cry  and there is nothing to be embarrassed about.   Crying can be very cathartic and can allow us to release a lot of painful feelings we have been stuffing down.   Crying is  often a sign that you are really working things through and getting in touch with feelings that you need to get in touch with in order to heal .So , to summarize , don't worry at all about crying! It will probably feel uncomfortable  at first , but I promise you , you will not be judged for crying in therapy.   And it will be less embarrassing once it happens a time or two and you are assured that your therapist will be there for you and won't judge you !Good luck !"
111,"I start counseling/therapy in a few days (I'm freaking out) but my main fear is that I'll cry and embarrass myself, is it something to worry about?","When talking about difficult issues, it is very normal to cry. Crying is a natural way for us to cope with the sadness that we experience in life. When confronting some of these things in a counseling session, tears just seem to come naturally. Every Counselor should be well equipped to handle that level of emotion, and you would be far from the first to cry when talking with a Counselor."," Hi, Counseling can be very nerve-wracking. And, it takes courage to reach out for help. My guess is that you would not be counseling if your counselor did not have a good understanding of your values and how they work. Counseling is a risky venture because you may find (wrong) a therapist, or your counseling goals may be different. But, that's okay. You are right to raise this concern with your counselor. You may want to take some time and think about your counseling goals carefully.  Are you sure this is what you want to work on? Do you want to work with only women?  Do you want to have a different kind of relationship with you? Do you want to have open and honest communication with your therapist? If this is the case, you have some leeway in terms of what you can ask of your therapist.  You can also ask your therapist what role he would like you to play in.  If you're comfortable with your role as counselor, that's great.  But if you feel you want to only work with women, that's different than you might feel with a friend. That's your choice.   You can decide for yourself what you want to ask of your therapist.  And, sometimes what you want to believe and what you feel you can agree on with your therapist.  It's important to always ask yourself those questions and to analyze what you're feeling"

Throughout the entire process, you have tried to give your therapist feedback as to what you are looking for in counseling, and this has come to the point where the therapist is willing to share this with you for you to understand. As you progress through the sessions, you will be challenged to show your therapist what you have learned, what is helpful in sessions, and what you would like to learn from your experiences so that you can make a decision about what is best for you in therapy.
