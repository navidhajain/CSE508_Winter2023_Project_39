I don't have the exact details, but I want to encourage you to put your efforts into this because it might open the conversation that could open the conversation to a connection.I wonder if you could tell me your interest in having a conversation with someone of whom you feel passionate and open, is not just because of the quality of the relationship but also because of how much you feel connected to yourself.I would ask a few things:What are the reasons you feel you are attracted to this person?  Are they happy and have they made you feel valued and appreciated?  Are there other aspects of your relationship that you are willing to work on to reach your sexual interest?What other relationships do you want to have that are satisfying for you?What else might you find attractive about these other people?The things you might ask for in a meeting with me would be:1) Were the other people around when you are in college, was this also a factor, or was this a common element?2) Did your boyfriend have a good time with you, and if so, had a good time with you?3) If the two of you are in good spirits, would you want to see each other more often or not at all or just once a week?Basically, if there are other factors at play here, I would suggest looking into the relationship to see if there is any underlying trend you see that points to attraction to both of you. <|endoftext|>\n",

In an effort to address this concern I will address my alma mater’s relationship with their HR department. I’m assuming they have that relationship, but it doesn’t seem to be working out that way. Please know that no matter what your alma mater does, HR is always there. I will do my best to process this in a safe and supportive process. context: As a trained therapist you can’t exactly answer this specific question, nor do you guarantee a fair and unbiased assessment of your alma mater’s ability to support you with this crucial area. However, the short answer should be brief and not indicate all possibilities.  The answer should be as objective and as matter of fact as possible so that you, or someone with you, can have an honest, up-to-date look at the situation. If your alma mater does not actively promote wellness at this time, then a proper assessment might be necessary.  Beyond addressing an accurate assessment, HR should be approached promptly by someone who can support you with this important area. <|endoftext|>\n",

It is possible that they are concerned about your emotional wellbeing and that you are developing serious depressive symptoms.   Your relationship is a unique one, and the people in charge of it are responsible for ensuring that your wellbeing is high.  It is important to understand why you are being hurt, as it is a fascinating journey that you will be leaving with many uncomfortable feelings.  You will find them over time, as new understanding and understanding flows within the relationship, allowing us to better understand and appreciate what is happening.  So, without giving you bad news, I do not believe in this idea that your boyfriend has developed any inner turmoil.  He is doing what is best for himself and the kids by his side.  I have recommended that he's had some form of separation from you in the past, but that doesn't address the fact that he is naturally very protective of his intimate partner’s emotional wellbeing.

How can I forgive him for what he did and show him his values instead of moving forward? context: Hi, this is really great that you are working so hard to make your relationship one that you can all build around. It's also true that moving forward can be scary and painful. Some of my colleagues have expressed that being a therapist can actually lead to an increase in self-doubt and feelings of inadequacy. Fear of trusting led to that belief, and I'm sorry to hear that. It may be helpful for you to seek out a therapist, because it looks like you may not be able to right now.

I specialize in helping couples to fix relationships and erect boundary items.

Not only are costs so daunting, but having a solid support system can also strengthen your defenses and make it much harder for abuse to get a foothold into your life. I'm not surprised to hear that your spouse is keeping a low profile. Therapy can be expensive, especially if you have the right person to take care of you. And remember, there are several ways to assist with your healing.I encourage you to explore the individual relationship that best fits with your needs.

She may be an amazing person, but one who can change her own mind, her own way of looking at herself, and your own mental state. How do I get her to understand? context: Hi Baton Rouge, I'm glad you're here. It's a bit ironic that the Girl Scout who decides who goes where, would be the one who's doing the deciding factor in how much freedom you have right now. It also sounds like you might want to consider whether or not you need as much personal freedom as possible. Is it more important that you choose freedom at this critical moment in your life? If you take freedom for granted, what makes it more important then... having more conversations about it make you more autonomous, or are you more often left feeling abandoned or something else? In the long run, a good many tasks in life determining freedom include being able to think objectively, to question beliefs, to be clear minded, to care about yourself and your choices, to contribute to your own happiness. That means being able to listen to your parents and care about them too. Is it possible this change in your mental state is happening more slowly than you might fear? If it is happening slowly, I hope you consider your own care and handling, using your honest and mature behavior, so that you can lead a caring life with integrity and independence.Best of luck. <|endoftext|>\n",

            " the relationship with her dad. context: Based on the information provided, your mom and the men in your life are the only ones who knowingly been emotionally harmed in some way by your ex. This could be understood as some form of abandonment or as a consequence of it, abandonment. There are abandonment myths in our families and most people believe that the mother and dad are the ones who magically magically transfer responsibility for our relationships with our kids off of you. However, this is not the case. The mother and father are in charge of all the decisions about the children's lives and decisions about the children's finances. All decisions about parenting and responsibilities for the children are being taken by the people in your life who created them. Based on what you describe about yourself in your post, you are not the first person that assumed parenting would be difficult. There are simply not enough people in the world to begin with. There are many reasons for this. The most important factor in parenting is nurture, nurture alone is not going to work in parenting. children don't have time for this kind of thing in their own home. not only did they not have the proper technology and a chance to learn in a safe and relaxed way, but also unfortunately they don't have the opportunity to acquire the means to self-protect their photos and information. This is going to take some doing in their own best interest to adopt. Unfortunately there is no way for a parent to know if their actions have changed as far as the chores and the child is able to do on their own or as a result of it. You mentioned children don't have the ability to ask for help from parents who know them well. do you feel that you child can? It can be frustrating when a parent refuses to help a child who needs some extra help. However, a good mother would want their kids to be placed in a healthy environment where they can learn to handle challenges from their own perspective. You say that your experience is that of \"The People Affected\". I know this from my own personal work as a Counselor. I have seen many people go through the motions of attending a therapy session, but when it comes to attending a therapy session, it is my job to be aware of what is going on around them and if there is anything that is difficult for them to do so without the therapist's help. However, I do see that you are not the first, and probably not the last. I am going to put my bet that these parents don't pick up on this and want them to make the most of this, because they are already doing something they can get behind. <|endoftext|>\n",

He's calling me horrible names and only picking up my calls. Is this abuse? context: What you are describing is the level of abandonment you are feeling as a child from your dad.You are not alone, and possibly more, than you realize what this is.There is no correct answer to this question.It is common for parents to look to the children in their lives for help. Without knowing much about their history, culture, beliefs, hobbies, interests, and so on, it is hard to say how best to model healthy family relationships. However, I do have some thoughts. You may be losing a friend, and you may be gaining a lot considering how you were raised. What has helped you most is what you needed? What you is experiencing now is helping you as well.That you are not alone is a good reason to look for a relationship in the future. Many people look for a relationship on the part of a specific person and that is often the person who buys you a drink after a night of drinking. They will talk about the details of their relationship and it is usually frowned upon. You may find yourself in a relationship with that person again if you have a good sense. Most likely it is worth trying to get the current occupant of the relationship to make amends. Usually, there is a chance the alcoholic may end up with you. Not every person is open to that.  And if the abuser is in the relationship itself, it is possible that it develops into a sexual relationship with you to increase that possibility. It is important to be aware of any behaviours that create conflict or idleness. Those that do not, will not seriously consider doing so. The next best thing is to try and find another suitable partner. Although it may seem like it would be more of a financial responsibility than monogamy, it is very important not to neglect your partner in such a way that it decreases your sexual intimacy. I would recommend really looking for a partner before you even realize it is open ended. There are usually at least three open ended relationships and polyamorous relationships. Some books are great on monogamy and other types of poly\n",

            "question: I know that I need to get past my feelings for this woman I love. However, I don't know if I should regret it. And, if I do, should I do it? context: Deciding to get past your feelings for a woman is a bit of a 'yes'.  It is one you really can't control.  Sometimes regret is a consequence of viewing life as being too complex and subject to many competing emotions.  Sometimes regret is the result of negative choices.  I get it. I think most people who go to see a therapist should consider themselves lucky if they get a good grade in their therapist's class.  If it turns out that the genuine mistake made in the first place because you are afraid of being judged, you will be glad you received a grade of C.In my practice I offer couples counselling.  The counselling takes the approach of assessing your needs and bringing a couples therapist to discuss these with you.  I prefer couples therapy in which you bring your concerns to the table and work with your therapist to figure out your preferred therapist.  I would also suggest seeking couples counselling out of state or large family practice with strict confidentiality. If you would like couples counseling I am available as is on and above the confidentiality of your reports.  Finding an out the other man's side of the law is also an issue you may want to consider.   On my website I have a link to the Texas Crisis Hotline which I call the Rights and Duties List.  You may reach a point where you feel more relaxed if you reach out and tell me what you want to discuss in this discussion.   I will get back to you.  Best of luck to you! <|endoftext|>\n",
            "question: I live with my partner of seven years who also works in insurance. We recently got pregnant. One of the first questions I wanted to ask was, \"Are you responsible for feeding all of your needs?\" I feel like I push him away as a cause and control and cover for one another. For example, he says he is responsible for his daughter, but I feel he is not fully responsible for her. He made a mistake and refuses to apologize for it, which is a huge loss to his daughter. He needs to make a better effort to do so, but I see it as a recipe for emotional and physical pain. context: It sounds like you are acknowledging that there may be feelings you do not like about your boyfriend. I wonder if you could turn those feelings into goals and communicate those feelings to him so he will learn to manage them and find ways to communicate about himself. In the future, when you are with him, I encourage you to try and ask him about his experiences and if you have ideas of ways to communicate about him. <|endoftext|>\n",

If he has a heavy drinking habit or has drug addictions, there is a risk that he will not be able to rely on your support again. Your love and support will serve him well. Your feelings of loss will not serve him well.  He must learn to trust his ally. When you meet with him, try to be friendly and non-judgmental with him.

I would also suggest putting together plans for a relationship where the two of you can discuss doing things that are essential to meeting your needs, such as eating appropriately and sleeping enough.

What should I do? context: Hi.   I'm sorry you are having such a tough time with this situation.  I have worked with a number of individuals in their lives who have had to move back home after being diagnosed with M.R.  You should consult with a mental health professional, get a referral to a mental health therapist, and generally sort through his or her life style to better understand what he is dealing with.  Most often, moving back home from one place to another is something you would seek guidance or perhaps even consent to live with.  As for whether you have financial resources, it will depend on how much space you have available to cry under the stress. People generally are not very generous Sponsor for Others because they put all of the needs of others before theirs.   Your having issues with your mother isn't surprising, and probably reflects your mother's primary concerns.  Having problems financially is certainly not something to be ashamed of and may just show that you are not able to provide yourself with the amount of support you would like. If you are concerned about your financial issues and looking for a local mental health professional, I would recommend looking in the State that you live in, in order to learn more about the characteristics that tend to make people destress and to contact your local area hospitals and clinics. <|endoftext|>\n",

How do I stop? context: I think that the best way to get an answer is to just ask. If you've ever told anyone about what's going on and been so humiliated, that you don't want to continue the behavior, is because you don't want people to know about it. And that's not even get to judge. The behavior is really helping you to get more acceptance into higher places. Maybe the behavior is part of who you are, but in the end, that doesn't mean you have to continue it.Just like we don't know for sure if you're panicking or if you're just being sneaky, the person that you love is hurting you to be panicking. That's WHY you need to talk to someone who you can trust. Someone who is not hiding behind apologies and promises and is actually helping you. Someone who doesn't hurt because they didn't need to \"figure out how to figure out how to find myself.\" It's BUNCH of mistakes that you need to make because someone else might be better at it and they aren't. You're not, in the end, able to make anyone else fail. You can learn from your mistakes and grow from them. I get the feeling from your writing that this is more than a bit of a self-doubt... this is an insecurity that we're not good enough or worthy before someone else. So in other words, aren't you trying to please people? That's who you are; we're not happy as the person. We want validation, but we also need space to learn who we are in a different person. Right? That might be the lesson to draw from - that you're not alone in this existential struggle. There are people out there needing to learn to love and to find ourselves. Find that desire and stand against it until you're with someone who loves and feels like you do. <|endoftext|>\n",

You want to tell his sense of how much he makes you proud.  I know that it might not be the best idea to tell him about that because it is important to you, but I know that he would appreciate it.

            " to what you need.You don't say how old you are. It's as though you're saying that, because you're self-employed, that makes you very tough on them and that makes their lives easier too.One suggestion is to see if you can find a counselor who is non-profitic and therefore isn't a hate group. There are certainly people who would not support violence on behalf of the people who injured them.But there are certainly people who would support the right to self-harm. If you decide that the non-profitic level is a good fit for you, then I'd suggest you start by trying to identify the organizations that you can find that do not support your cause. Do you have a local chapter? If you don't, you could find one through your local chapter website.I know you say that she avoids it. It's only fair that she does. But it's not healthy for her to avoid doing what she does because it will trigger hateful feelings.I'm curious as to the reason, if you haven't yet, or reason, why she doesn't want to do as you wish. It is often easier to just let her know in the first weeks or so of a new relationship what you need or want, than it is to tell her later and try to resolve the issue face to face. I would also make sure that you understand the difference between what you're doing and what you wish she would do instead of hiding it. Sometimes seeking support from friends and family can be helpful. Please contact me before you get started to express your concerns, or you can contact the school counselor or task force on anti-depressants and depression support. Scary things can happen, and unfortunately they're not healthy for anyone who is trying to cope. <|endoftext|>\n",
            "question: I'm dating a guy I really love. We have our problems, but I could see myself with him long term. But there's this other guy who I've been dating a lot of years ago. I really like this guy. He meets up with a lot of other guys in nice guy outfits. They're not as friendly, and I'm not always happy. I was recently walking through a list of curses I've heard over and over again. It's really my favorite part of the whole thing because it's about feeling loved and important to him. It's actually one of the hardest things I do because I want him to see that I'm still and important, but he doesn't. I think because of that difficulty, I try to be nice to him. However, he knows that I still crush on him. I does mean that I should strive for that love and respect, but I also know that if I did him anyway, I wouldn't be able to. I'm trying to be nice to him. I trying to be nice to him in every way. We haven't had a boyfriend in over a year. context: There are a lot of possible answers here. It's complicated and sensitive at times, but if you're dating someone who is not as friendly and connected to you as you are, having someone else contend for this respect is a better idea. You made a conscious decision to distance yourself from him. It may be healthy to focus on rebuilding the friendship that you have built up around him as opposed to focusing on competition from below. You're not the first person in the world to propose to a cheating boyfriend, so it doesn't sound like you are the first. I'm not sure how long you have been together as a whole, but I'm not sure whether you are dating as a way to show that you want to compete for this in the open bedroom or if you are just curious about this decision. The open bedroom part is popular and for the most of it, it's not entirely true that anyone should ever place so much importance on who is cheating on you. In fact, many people are quite happy when they are connected to someone for several years, although sometimes in very late love or in those who are very grudge towards him. The actual code word is dishonesty. People dishonesty is usually punished with up to six months in jail and a $5,000 fine. Sometimes people do it in order to avoid paying the fine, but it gets ugly very easily. <|endoftext|>\n",

            "question: I was with my boyfriend of five years dating on Long Island. We met through mutual friends. We met on Facebook and dated for a few weeks. We eventually broke up. He asked me to be his date so we could hang out. He was never my business. He was directing my attention towards his other friend, and I happened to be walking past his house at night. He decided to reach for the phone to try and hit me. I was scared and tried to run away, but I realized he was just saying bad things about me. I didn’t run away but I hid my face so he didn't notice. He hit me again and that was it. I lost my trust in him and need to start something new with him. context: I admire your ability to get over the psychological and emotional hump you had to get over your break up.  It is a difficult road for anyone you care about.  You live in a society in which being bisexual is considered a basic social norm.  This is not the world you expect or know you have at this time.  So, how did you handle it? How did you feel after your boyfriend was outed?  Did you accept his actions?  Did he sit idly by and wait for you to come clean?  Was he quiet because you saw him talking out loud or did he erupt in anger because you didn't do anything productive?  Were you passive aggressive because you didn't hesitate to contact him or told him about your actions?  Did you lie to him because you felt afraid to come clean and convey your feelings to him?  Were you pressured into silence because you didn't hesitate to take his word?  Were you treated with contempt because you tried to talk to him only on the phone or was it because you felt you had no choice but to speak to him by video conferencing? What might have been professional defenses might have been there to stop you from getting away.  If you tried to do something constructive in your relationship, you might have a tough time ending it.  Instead of retreating and trying to stop him, try to do something in return.  \"Iland\" means \"I need help\", and \"I am worthless\".  The latter is an effective \"take a bite out\" strategy. If you were a male in a way that prevented you from meeting your potential and getting back together, and you were able to, I recommend you seek professional help immediately to manage the situation.  The harmful effects on your relationship and yourself are well understood.  However, it is important that you also seek professional help because \"distance\" is an important part of the relationship.  When you cannot resolve the distance, you may develop other issues, which include depression, insecurity, low self-esteem or fears, self-confidence issues, loneliness.  Most importantly, you need to address them on a deeper level and ask for a different path.  My advice is for you to seek out a therapist who can help you unravel the distance and build a new relationship without manipulation. <|endoftext|>\n",

What you did was dare to cross Overland Private Property into her county because she had no tolerance for human abuse. There was already a report made a week after the fact of an armed robbery at least five victims. There was a subsequent armedazo at least ten times, and the Sheriff's Office claimed it was enough to keep you from ever getting a single break in this case.Since you had the phone of a trusted adult, snap a picture of the same with a tagline such as \"I am a good person and I guarantee you I am capable of loving more human beings than me.\" Translator: I love that you tried to be a good parent and knew you would fall under what you called a \"depressive disorder\". I think that talking with a therapist about upsetting memories could be helpful to you. Often memories are processed and we may need to talk to someone about those upsetting memories in order to gain a better idea of how the changes in self-esteem and capacity for satisfying life are different people. You may also want to consider working with a therapist who is trained to help people recognize the good in others and to bring new life to those upsetting memories. Good luck! <|endoftext|>\n",

That you were able to have positive interactions with others and still feel anxious? That you cannot remember all the times that you have felt anxious? That your anxiety is not related to the events? It is more of an experience to experience, and it is common to experience an increase in anxiety related symptoms. The best care is had in the case that one or both of you develop anxiety related symptoms. If the both of you develop late in therapy then the anxiety may be treated with a combination of counseling, medication, and self discovery. <|endoftext|>\n",

            "   I lay awake at night thinking and having conversations in my head and i almost always end up making myself feel terrible and crying, anyway. context: It sounds as though you are treating your panic attacks with anxiety. However, there are many treatments for anxiety that work well with therapy and are able to effectively manage the symptoms.  You may need some local access to a shelter for rent or, if you are unable to afford a couple of therapists in a private home.  First, you need to determine what types of therapy and services can be done. Therapy provides a safe place to discuss with a safe person what bothers you about the behavior.  Second, you need to find a recognized behaviorist who can help you learn what is causing you anxiety. Finding someone who can mentor you to relax and speak in your Headspace will give you a space where you can truly engage in life without being anxious.  Third, it takes a therapist who is trained to help clients tolerate and manage anxiety.   There are safe places where you can go to learn more about yourself and why you hold back from relating parts of a past.   The search for self-expression is a healthy way to feel better and this is one of the most rewarding things a person can do. <|endoftext|>\n",

Can counseling help? context: Anyone who is trying to change their feeling of insecurity and inadequacy, and is attempting to build a more secure and satisfying life from nothing fantasyally happens to quickly get blasted with the dreaded \"is this good for me?\" impression. The true matter is not whether or not you feel better, it is how you feel feel feel.  If you are particularly bothered by your feelings toward your current partner, you may want to find a quiet place where you can vent your feelings and maybe even come up with a different answer to your partner that feels more secure and realistic. Often, when someone is digging deeply in, the partner feels some relief to know that they are not as isolated in this very real and painful way. Unfortunately, this is not always the answer that you seek. Sometimes uncertainty and fear can convince us that we should give it up, however, it does not mean that we are wrong to want to lose it. In fact, psychotherapy can provide hope and gain a stronger sense of control over our thoughts and behaviors.  CBT can provide a space where we can ask ourselves why is it that person does not feel safe to express what we need to express.  If we can gain a clearer sense of what was said and get to that acceptance that our actions and words mean what we want to say, then we may be able to move past our negative thoughts and start to feel secure in our lives. <|endoftext|>\n",

He states crazy behavior and thoughts, and I am always the only one fighting him off. He is always changing and changing he tells me, and I am always right in his ear. context: I'm sorry to hear that your husband is constantly changing his behavior.There are many good therapists out there that provide adaptive behavior therapy (AP) which helps to model and assist in rebuilding a healthy self for the future. <|endoftext|>\n",

We also have two kids together, and our kid keeps saying that he is just lying. I'm having a difficult time connecting with him because he seems so me I Can't Explain It To You! kind of guy. context: I think that it is important that you have the safety and comfort of someone who is in a relationship and you are concerned about your husband and your children.  The marriage promotion material for your child requires you to believe that there is a \"sweet spot\" in the relationship. This is a foundational element in the children's childhood and if the marriage is meant to create \"distance,\" then you will lose out on the relationship.  However, it is also important to be aware of how your child's actions and words lead to actual physical pain and suffering. Underneath that, a foundation needs to be built:  Respect for each other, empathy for each other, and feeling secure in your relationship. Some people like to soak in physical activities or meditation, but there is a disconnect between what they are doing and what you are physically doing in the relationship. I think that, if we engage in things that you are doing, there will be less need to be said about what is not okay for you to do.  If you are doing things that you are uncomfortable about or need some space, there are many apps that you can find that address that problem. A quick search for \"therapy in progress\" will give you some ideas.More information will likely be helpful as well.Best of luck to you. <|endoftext|>\n",

And, if you're concerned about the influence of another male in the relationship, and are unable to express your needs or desires in the relationship, it's time to move on and find a new relationship. By seeking to resolve these issues, you and the marriage can avoid the wrinkles. The good news is that with professional help you can feel better and you will be more present and connected to each other. If you still feel isolated and silenced, it's time to find someone that you can connect with and build a lasting lifelong connection with.

Yesterday, she said she wanted a divorce then quickly changed her mind. I asked if the other guy was a factor, but she says it's not my business. context: The specific laws about married same-sex relationships are generally quite different from state to state. Same-sex couples in most states are not affected by this change. Same-sex marriage is still a legal marriage in most but one of the difficulties is that there are no state laws against same-sex marriage. In addition, unlike in state law, the married couple cannot adopt children from his parent. The reason for this is because his biological parents cannot be separated from the couple because of differences in parenting methods such as improper legal strategies and religious beliefs. However, your wife is not affected by the change. The children are not affected by the divorce. It is a good thing that your wife is willing to take care of your emotional and legal duties. <|endoftext|>\n",

You may not realize it but you know it.  To help you manage your feelings and learn how to live without this negative feeling to yourself, I would suggest a conversation where you both discuss your concerns and how you both feel pressure to do the right thing and learn ways to integrate your personal experiences and people and places to live.  It may be an hour or two right or right and forgotten because it doesn't feel helpful to everyone.  I would recommend speaking with a therapist in your area and getting some practical tips and tools you can use to manage your emotions and learn ways to manage your actions and self-understanding so you can live a more balanced life.  Also available are a book titled, Living the Life to Live the Life You Want, by Peter deGrasse and Esther Perelman.  It is a very common book (if not the rule) and helps you to understand the different types of happiness.  It is a great resource for anyone that wants to learn more about themselves and their lives. <|endoftext|>\n",

In your case, it sounds like you are looking at a different time in your life than the time you would like to be alone with your husband. With a little time work you could possibly tease out the full story of your feelings at the very early stages, and perhaps even help you with identifying some of the reasons for why you are feeling the way you are feeling. From what you have written, you may find it worthwhile to write letters to your husband and assess whether your husband is willing to discuss these feelings with you. In the letter, you mention that you are separated and that you are still related. In the letter, you mention that you are still friends and that you are still married. In the letter, you list all the reasons you are still together and ask if you can be in more of a conversation as a couple.

I know that no matter what I do or how I change, there will always be some people who hate me. Why do I feel this way? context: It is normal to feel attraction to people. The soul, the material and the spirit world are within us very tightly interweaving at this stage. We are not, as far as our mental health professional life goes, really connected to one another. Our everyday life is like a maze of unconnected parts, each with their own particular requirements and difficulty in complying with these requirements. The more we try to follow the realizations about ourselves that we are part of this \"maze\" of unconnected parts, the more we start to feel and experience the realizations about ourselves that we are connected to these parts. The more we connect to one another, the more we can satisfy these realizations and gain a sense of security in our lives.If the attraction is somehow related to something that happened or to a specific outcome (for example, a particular person's grades or performance in a program, or a particular situation), then this becomes a real concern for you. But being aware of our emotions may be the first step to feeling more deeply involved in your life. You can know you have a problem if you are comfortable opening up and saying to yourself how you feel.

            " context: Your boyfriend is in stable physical health (not cancer). Do you know what his health is like a month ago? Your boyfriend is 100% sure he has a drug addiction. If you feel that he has that kind of addiction, then it is a good time to have talked about it with someone. Talking about it will give you a brief insight into what the issues are that lead to and encourage you to seek help. I have seen many people that are having withdrawal symptoms, but this is simply a symptom of something worse. I suggest medication that can help calm them down a bit, and/or monitor them so they don't repeat the problem. Some people look for and manage benzodiazepines and that may be the main contributing factor that we see in our lives, but it seems that there may be a lack of trust between the two of you. The \"addiction\" to a behavior may be that the behavior is not helping the person, and the person could become addicted to benzodiazepines. If that is the case, I see you as stuck in the addiction. If you have been trying to get him to take less of your alcohol, weed, or other substance, and he hasn't taken you seriously, that needs to be addressed. You could ask him if he has been truthful in his answers to your questions. Some people want to give him a second chance, but need the money, and maybe have lied about their past or are trying to hide the truth. If this is complicated, I would check with a therapist really experienced in sexual abuse addiction. The answers might point to some other medications that might be helpful. Look for someone that is specifically trained in addressing addiction. <|endoftext|>\n",

You can also Google search \"boyfriend\" or \"girlfriend\" or search under the terms \"bisexual, transgender, orisexual\". Your question is pretty definitive. There is also the \"I don't know how to make love to him\" tag. If you don't know how to make love to him, I wonder how long that could take. It can be intense, but I think maybe you can learn more about your own experience with openness.If you find this is the case, please seek the help of a professional who can work with you building a trusting relationship.

It is never a good thing to have another woman involved. The fact that you are aware that you aremoaning her abandonment is a very good step towards self-expression protection. Abusive communication is no longer only about \"how I am doing\" but also \"how I feel about this woman who I fell in love with.\" Examine the relationship that you are having - do it! Are you jealous that your wife feels she is not able to see your love for her? Or are you jealous that your wife feels she is still in the marriage? It is possible that these reactions are being triggered by an actual realignment in relationship dynamics.Keep in mind that experiencing a relationship's most pressing matters, such as feeling overwhelmed by your wife's emotions, feeling powerless to change her behavior, feeling queasy within yourself, and feeling a great deal of guilt! Some people like to engage in confrontation-filled behaviors because that is how their partner feels about them. Someone who duels with their ex, yells and screams at them, whereas a true loving partner doesn't necessarily yell and scream at them. You may be able to get some of those \"alarm systems\" in order because you have experienced anxiety about something that was very uncomfortable for you, or because you are comfortable expressing your feelings about it. First, let's identify what emotions you are feeling in connection to your sister. Are you happy, do you fear her elimination, or is it something else? If you are afraid of being alone, may joining a relationship be necessary?Have you tried to talk your way out of the situation? If you can't, there are better ways to handle these situations than how you would normally handle it. If you are still in shock, it is a good time to have a discussion about what you are afraid of and what you wish for. It is important to have that conversation before a relationship because it is a time to have calm and relaxed in order to have the opportunity to express all of your emotions, including your fear of being alone. If you are still in shock, a good therapist will be able to help you process your emotions so you can have the discussion that you want to have. <|endoftext|>\n",

            "question: I'm in a relationship with my fiancé and I currently found out that she's been cheating on me with a co-worker. I was very upset none the less. I understand, and feel this way, because I see this as a contrast with my other interests. I get sad all the time, and I know it's because I'm being cheated on. I don't want to lose this relationship, and I also don't want to be the one who gets hurt. context: Have you guys talked to her about it? It's probably not normal for us to always say what is important to us in relationships, and it makes it even harder for us to know what is going on. It makes it much more difficult to know what to say to each other, and can make it more difficult for you to connect. What is important, though, is that you love her as your wife, and that you move forward with her in a way that brings you both into this relationship. That is, until that time, do you feel secure in your relationship? Learn more about yourselves and each other, and then prioritize what she is willing to say and do. She may even say she doesn't like talking about this, but that's okay. It's okay to say \"no more acrobatics\" or \"no more the distractions\". Loving someone does not mean that you stop being a person, but rather that you start to feel that being one raises a glass that is not in the sky. (But still, that glass is missing and your view of each other, which is very limited.)So, the not-so-good news though is that feeling of not being loved is also not uncommon for some couples. The uncomfortable truth is that you can never really separate the love for the other person and the love for the marriage, so there are several things you can do here to help distinguish the two.First, you may want to find a local support group for couples to feel either too scared to leave or too afraid to the point that they will lose the good feelings for the partner they love. They will learn that the barriers to loving each other are actually obstacles to living happinessfully together, which is a good thing. Second, it is important to create clear rules about what is acceptable in relationships. These include:  Always respect what you create for your partner. <|endoftext|>\n",
            "content: Soothing self-esteem and positivity are assets your partner will be investing in. Helping your partner see the positive in you helps them be content and more fluid. Plus, seeing your partner show this positive self-esteem usually takes time, and they often have very impulsive thoughts, which can be problematic if they feel the need to show they are the best person in the world. I know how great that must feel, but you can take action and take action now. The more you allow your partner to demonstrate this positive self-esteem, the better they will be able to put you in a positive light, and the easier it will be to get through the anger phase. I would highly recommend working with this counselor, and it sounds like he may be a good fit for you! <|endoftext|>\n",

I read the DSM-IV, taken college psychology, etc. I know it in my heart I have them. Is self-diagnosing okay with the right research? context: Any diagnosis is limited in its usefulness.Knowing the name of some typical ways you may feel, think and behave, doesn't help you or anyone to understand why the person is the way they are and how to change any of these characteristics.Both self-diagnosing and being diagnosed are equally unhelpful to know why you are the way you are and what to do about it.Consider yourself a person who wants to find a better way to be who you are, and this will get you further with better results than to read a list of descriptions which all are very indicting and negative sounding. <|endoftext|>\n",
            "question: I'm currently struggling with diagnosed depression, anxiety, and Misophonia. Also, I am 99% sure I have Borderline Personality Disorder and Avoidant Personality Disorder. I read the DSM-IV, taken college psychology, etc. I know it in my heart I have them. Is self-diagnosing okay with the right research? context: Hello, and thank you for your question. Self-diagnosing is something that we all do about one health issue or another. Taking a guess about what may or may not be happening to us is completely normal, however the actual clinical diagnoses of a mental health disorder requires a licensed mental health professional. Here are a few reasons for this: 1. Making a clinical diagnosis often requires other things besides matching up the symptoms of a disorder. To come to a diagnoses for any of the things you mentioned, a counselor would consult the DSM, but they may also use some type of screening tool, assessment or scale. Many disorders have similarities and it requires someone with training to tease out the differences in the symptoms. 2. Our judgement is sometimes off when it comes to assessing ourselves. We really can't be objective. Something as serious as determining a diagnosis really needs to be done by someone who has that objectivity. In addition, once you know your diagnosis, treating it usually requires help from a professional. 3. Sometimes the symptoms of a mental health disorder makes self-diagnoses impossible, in and of itself. For example, someone could be having hallucinations or delusions and not realize it. That would clearly make it impossible for them to diagnose themselves. There a many examples where something like this could happen with different mental health disorders. There are other reasons, but these are three important ones. Now, does this mean that you are wrong about your diagnosis? Maybe not. You may be correct. But, it is important to get this confirmed by a professional mental health clinician. If a disorder is then found, you can start to talk about treatment. Hope this was helpful. Be well.Robin J.

I think I'm okay now, but I always liked girls. context: This is a common experience you're having, and certainly starting to get annoying. It's normal to feel down when you're not in a relationship, and especially when you start hanging out with these people who make you feel crappy and crappy. With that being said, it also be BS - whatever it is that you are hearing or seeing in their head. It can be anything (for example, \"I can't get through middle school and high school anymore\"), but when you take the time to examine and acknowledge what you were doing before, that's what you are learning new. Also, I believe you know that by focusing on something that you are already doing, your brain can be fixed. The fix is in order, and because this is an important part of who you are, it is important to understand what that person was dealing with. Once you understand that, and be able to communicate more effectively, the good things will begin to change. I would encourage you to look into working with a therapist who specializes in helping to change long-standing habits, because this is a crucial skill for which you would like a License. <|endoftext|>\n",

That time may have been lost in the sea of genderqueer people who celebrate and celebrate one sex. But there is a way to celebrate and celebrate yourself. You can do it! There's a book called \"When Gender is Open: Dialectical Behavior From a Sexual to a Sexuality\" by Dr. David Gottman.

            "question: I'm on the phone with my girlfriend every day. I don't know what to say if I'm worried or anything. I just get really confused and usually say my birth gender. context: Hello, and thank you for writing with your question. At the begin g of our relationship, I would suggest really asking your own thoughts on the issue of whether or not you are okay with being a boy or girl. Some people say they are okay with being a boy and some not so much. There are many people who are okay with being a girl and would say that it is okay for them to be called whatever you want to call it. But some people say it is also inappropriate for them to be called whatever you are. I suggest you find a counselor or a trusted friend and tell them if you are being insensitive or outed. I get that this is a tough spot for you both. If you want to work on this, I suggest that you write down what is written as \"on the phone.\" It sounds like what you are saying is in the context of something that is written on a piece of paper. If you send an email or something along this lines, you could usually confirm what is going on and talk more about the details. If you continue to have anxiety or have thoughts of being transgendergally or transgender as a identity, I would suggest talking about what is going on with your family and seeing a local mental health professional. Some people have a family history and a close friend or family member. If you are bi, then all of a sudden you can talk about your history and your current identity. People who are transgendergally are most often queergally and transgender is only a phase. My private practice uses therapy to discuss and process those experiences. I would also ask you if you have been in therapy before and if you have been supportive and happy with how you were going. Having a doubt as to whether or not you are transgender can be a good first step. If you feel like you are or are telling yourself that you are transgender, a therapist or a family member can usually help you as best you can. <|endoftext|>\n",

Sometimes you may cry, sometimes you may feel joy, and sometimes you may feel relief. Sometimes you might even cry and grieve. Sometimes you might even be empathetic, and the therapist may reward empathy by increasing your optimism by replacing your negative thought patterns.When you cry, don't let thoughts about how you're feeling with thoughts about how you're sad or worried or ashamed of how you're feeling in a negative way. Give yourself one more chance to cry and then see how happy you are! <|endoftext|>\n",
            "question: Is it normal for people to cry during therapy, or is it just me? context: Yes, it is very normal to cry during a therapy appointment.  When you meet with a counselor, you are opening yourself up and sharing very vulnerable sides of yourself.  Through this deep introspection, emotions (sometimes unexpected) can come out and this is completely okay and very healthy.  Research has shown that crying reduces pain by releasing oxytocin and endorphins and reduces stress through the release of stress reduction hormones. <|endoftext|>\n",

            "question: Is it normal for people to cry during therapy, or is it just me? context: Yes, absolutely. In therapy you will be delving into topics and feelings that are often suppressed throughout daily life. As you explore many emotions may come up, anger, disappointment, grief, frustration, sadness, to name a few. These and many other emotions often lead to crying and your therapist will be there to hold space and support you through it.

            " a great idea to start. Sometimes, it can be hard to create an alarm system and set up a timer, but a more important piece of info is to act as a \"watchdog\" to those who attempt to break your trust. The first step is re-building trust. Yes, you should tell him that you are there for him, but if you are going to tell him that you actually can't trust him, then you need to tell him about that too. Yes, this is a basic human need, but it cannot be tested on a high. Other times, yes, anger can be part of testing a relationship. When we feel overwhelmed with our own or someone else's needs, we tend to turn to anger. If you feel overwhelmed by your own or someone else's needs, you may want to ask yourself questions about why you turn to anger. Do you feel hurt or guilty? Misunderstanding? There could be any number of things.I would recommend, contacting your school counselor and voicing your concerns. Some parents will be glad to assist your school counselor if you histories some history. I would also encourage you to take the initiative to question your decision to stay and the decision to go to counseling. Many local treatment centers will be able to provide you with a list of expected casters and will also have some guidance about what casters may and may not be trained in counseling. You could also ask your school counselor about what might be a problem for you in your area and see if there is a school that might be open to you.Hope this helps. <|endoftext|>\n",

Licensed counselors generally completed 4 years of college and an additional 2 years of graduate school. If you are thinking about a career in psychology, the local APA chapter would be a good place to start to find a local psychologist to talk to.

I also wanted to know if they enjoy their job and how long they were in school. context: Mental Health is an exciting and rewarding field.  I hear you saying that you want to be a psychologist, and that is one path to working in mental health.  You could study psychology, social work or counseling to become a practicing therapist. I am a Licensed Professional Counselor Associate and a Licensed Clinical Addiction Specialist.  I currently provide assessments and supervise several counselors in a large clinic in Asheville.  I also have a private practice online. I studied Sociology and Interpersonal Communication as an undergraduate, and then I received a counseling masters degree.   My master's degree was comprised of several supervised practice courses and theory courses.    I really enjoyed my education, and I find my career equally rewarding and enjoyable. If you are considering working in the field, I recommend emailing several counselors, social workers, and psychologists in your area and setting up an informational interview.  Not everyone you contact will be willing to give you their time, but many may.   This will help you determine which path to therapy may be right for you.  Licensing restrictions and abilities vary state to state and a local practitioner may be able to provide you with a specific list of challenges/triumphs about their particular license and education.    Psychologists are usually PhD level practitioners and require more education to begin.  LCSWs , LPCs and LMFTS can practice with a master's degree.  Best of luck!

The important thing to remember is that your identity as bisexual is valid and you are worthy of love, no matter what other people believe or tell you. The only exception to this would be who believe that being bisexual is bad and deny that it is stigmatizing. Another family member may tell a story of how they feel respected and loved by that family, and then end it with a family member who is also bisexual. It is important to remember that family members may define and experience some variation in behavior if they do not already have much experience with that phenomenon.Third, it is important to remember that there is nothing to be ashamed of. There is likely something that you have been experiencing or present that is contributing to the way that you are feeling. Regardless of what, you are still important and worthy of love and support. Fourth, when we are in pain, we are imaging a future that is completely missing the present. The cornerstone of any therapeutic practice is that when we can move our focus inward it can begin to resemble a future that is missing the present. The good news is that you have choices to make.

I would encourage you to seek out a supportive person to help you with this and see if there is anything that supports your view. If there is none that would be helpful for you then you need to find a counselor or find someone who is trained to work with couples. Partners generally are not comfortable in counseling and a counselor would not be able to help fully understand what you have been experiencing.

            "question: After I told them, they yelled at me. context: Hello, and thank you for your question. I completely agree with Dr. Zehner. Many couples are in open-type or polyamorous relationships, where both partners engage in sexual relationships with their partner for almost daily interactions. The question is not so much who we allow to come into the marriage, but what the rules are for both of us. Here are some general ideas about what might be okay with each of us: 1. If you're in a relationship that offers marriage and openheartedly, it might be beneficial to make it easy for you to come in and out, without either of you having to physically verify or attest to your marriage. If you are in a relationship that offers open-mindedness, offering vows and then asking the other person to sign a contract that details what they might do (e.g. they might give you information that might be used in the trial and evaluation) could give each of you a chance to realize they have done what they can to be treated with kindness and respect in the present. 2. If you are in a relationship where both people are willing to do whatever it takes to be treated with kindness and respect, it might be beneficial to make the process a bit easier for you to do so. For example, if you know you have different answers to your question and the answer is yes, then give it a shot.Although it may be difficult, if a clean answer is what is probably the right thing to do, then consider working with a couples therapist to discuss questions that arise for you regarding the\n",

I wonder if I was over reacting. I feel more broken since this has happened to me before. It's almost like I'm no longer safe. context: Your fear is somewhat reasonable. On the plus side, you know that this relationship is hard and fast coming to a end, which is generally an important good thing. I am worried about you somewhat and am glad that you know that you are having some positive changes happen. You are lucky to have a supportive partner with you for sharing yourself. I am worried that things like this can turn into episodes or a walk in with some deep seeded question. In any case it is a sign that you are not going to connect with anyone long-term.

            " him, especially since he doesn't even want to get back to his old ways of relationship-fianceing, and certainly doesn't want to see her beg for custody of his child.  What might be stopping you from ending this relationship, is for what reason you did end it.  You didn't act with your current boyfriend toward you in any way;  He doesn't even want to see you beg for custody of your child.  He instead got what is becoming of himself and continues to plague you with accusations and accusations of these sorts of things.  Ask yourself these questions: Why am I angry that he's leaving me? What will happen then? What am I trying to do with my life to clear my mind of this anger? Why am I so depressed? How do I make myself invisible to this anger? Does he care that I'm actually angry?  What are the alternatives? am I willing to risk it causing more harm to my relationship with him? If I was your therapist (or someone else's), I'd be trained in how to work with these types of situations. I recommend working with a professional with close to your relationship to learn how this is a difficult situation that you feel you need to deal with on your own rather than hoping someone else will come to help you. It's incredibly difficult to deal with anger like this, but here are a few things to try: 1. Practice with a competent therapist. Having a professional can be a great source of support because people feel heard and can tell others what they are able to achieve. 2. Attend therapy. I strongly encourage you to attend the monthly meeting of the Counselor. It is a safe environment to share your feelings and tricks that allow others to interact with you. Additionally, I highly encourage you to engage in online dating sites like /r/AskMen and /r/AskMengeorgia where you can meet, find a woman, try out a fetish, try out a vibrator, get undressed, have fun in makeup, etc. Along with that, I would encourage you to engage in activities that help you feel empowered, independent, happy and in control. The second part of your relationship is about finding the total stranger relationship.  Each of you needs to enjoy being in a relationship with yourself and making your own personal changes as you discover yourself. <|endoftext|>\n",

            "    I am seeing someone casually and I am losing my mind with anxiety about how he feels about me and this need for validation.\n",
            "   How can I learn to be in a relationship in a way that I can be in a healthy and loving way with my partner? context: Hi! Thank you for your question. It's a great question! To start off, I would suggest that you learn some self-care techniques that you can use instead of trying to force yourself to do what's natural. For example, you may decide to buy some used lingerie from a random women's department store and then regret the event. You could also try to plan a date in which you both get to do what you love about it. These things can be wonderful for us when we are not romantically involved with our partner. But if you are going to have those thoughts about seeing someone else, I would suggest that you see a therapist so you can have some centered listening during those thoughts. Without knowing more, these thoughts can lead to a feeling of insecurity, which is very common. They can also lead to feelings of worry if we are to focus on the possibility that something bad is going to happen. So, while I can say that having these thoughts is completely normal, I would encourage you to seek some help and awareness to lessen these feelings of insecurity. Learning more about yourself and what you are willing to give and receive is the first step in finding out if you are actually addicted to benzodiazepines. <|endoftext|>\n",

This is not totally abnormal, but for some people it is a personal thing. Some people feel that they have a reason to be attracted to other people, but much of what is going on in your world is subconsciously you.  People tend to try to create scenarios that they will fill up with emotion because they know that if they behaved in a scenario like this it would not be something you wanted to hear.  You can find more information by going to http://www.fatherhood.org/. <|endoftext|>\n",

You did your dad's words and actions and now we know why. What is important is you accept him for who he is and know that you did not expect him to react this way. Just take the next step and support you in your growth. This is not an easy situation and I understand how it can be difficult to see your child struggling. There are no easy answers but more work is needed.  Often times children feel that they can not change others so they take action. This is not something you can do alone.  Encourage your child to use the “social worker” number to reach out for help.  This is a good place to start.  The fact that you are reaching out for help is validation of your efforts.

It could be that he wants you to know that he is upset and wants to talk about it in order to help you come to your own conclusions. The problem is that while you are there, consider having a conversation with him. Ask him what he is thinking and responding to and asking for his reasons for your feelings.

If you are asking questions, try to have as many people around you while you are experiencing it. A good way to have this conversation is to ask the people in your life who are with you the most and ask them if they know about how you prepare to talk.

He says he loves me but says the things that I mistreatful and call me names. He says he will do anything to get me back. Is he willing to learn to move back? context: Unfortunately you seem to have yourself in a double bind. You need to protect yourself from his lying. He needs to believe that you are the \"right\" parent to live. What do you tell yourself about your role in protecting yourself is that you are doing what is natural for you. We are all beings prone to change and experimentation. Typically when we need a bit of help we are able to look for a therapist who is competent in their work and understand that what you are experiencing is not normal.I think it is also important to be aware of expectations in relationships. With that being said I have learned that most therapists (if not all) who are in their 40s practice only recommend interventions that are specific to your problem groups, not surgery. So if you feel that you are not receiving the therapy that you are entitled to, it does not mean that you are a bad therapist - in fact, that it is a bad therapist. Many clients come into therapy with numerous issues rather than just one particular thing. Most of the time, the issues relate to and exacerbate each other. We call these \"comorbid\" conditions, which means that two or more mental status problems exist at one time. A lot of the times, when you start to work on one issue, the other issues get better as a result.I hope you will find your healing journey worthwhile! <|endoftext|>\n",

            "   I’ve never had counseling about any of the issues you mention. I have never had counseling about anything. Do I have too many issues to address in counseling? context: I believe that in order for you to begin healing, it is necessary that you participate in counseling. However, I also believe that when you begin to engage in things that you never imagined occurring, things can get a lot difficult. Things like developing healthy boundaries, and communicating your feelings are so important. If you are not ready to engage in counseling, I would recommend that you talk with a licensed counselor who has experience in sexual abuse and trauma overall. <|endoftext|>\n",

I don't know what's wrong with me and why I feel this way. What should I do? context: If you're in a generalized emotion family of worry like anger, disappointment, and fear, this may be helpful.The various types of anxiety medications are different in that there are different types of hormones that affect how much someone is able to feel in their body.One suggestion is to understand each of those aspects more deeply so that you are better understood within them.Anxiety usually follows a event because of emotions.   People describe feeling anxious because someubordinating, like when they feel anxiousest--\"I can't breathe in here.ito\" or \"I can feel my stomach watered a lot.\"   That sort of thing can be profoundly comforting to those of us who are having those tough conversations.I think knowing more about your experience will help you to be able to guide your own thoughts and feelings.  You may also discover, rather quickly, that the fear is somewhat reasonable.  If having conversations about it is uncomfortable for you, then maybe you look into couples therapy where couples therapists will be able to help you figure out what is most comfortable for you and what may not be okay for you at all. <|endoftext|>\n",

What can I do? context: The idea that you don't KNOW if you want to face danger, is a common one. If you want to think about what your fear is I would suggest starting with really small \"challenge\" gatherings and especially these gatherings that succeed in \"suicide acceptance\" (techniques such as the '4 steps to ending the counseling session' may help). Once you and your psychologist have a good idea of where you want to go with counselling activities, I would suggest giving yourself permission to go visit your doctor or therapist to check in with them frequently to make sure they think seriously about your intervention. <|endoftext|>\n",
            "question: I have a fear of something and I want to face that fear to overcome it, but I don't know how. What can I do? context: Fear is a part of life. In fact, our five main emotions are joy, fear, sadness, shame, and anger. We tend to spend a lot of time and energy running away from or trying to get rid of most of our other emotions. This creates the dilemma of whether or not we can do this or not. If you want to tackle this problem, you will need a therapist who is PhD in theysics, or cosmology, and an expert in dynamic communication. The therapist will help you to develop healthy ways to cope with your fear and any other strong emotions that are lingering in your life.You can find a therapist by doing a bit of research to see if what you are experiencing is possible and helpful. If you feel that you can talk to your therapist in a way that will be helpful to you, you can. <|endoftext|>\n",
            "question: I have a fear of something and I want to face that fear to overcome it, but I don't know how. What can I do? context: This fear is in some people's minds as \"they always think I have the answer, but I don't know how.\" Another thing to try and remember is that it is possible to change what happens in your life. Sometimes we learn skills that allow us to do things we never want to do and it can be a good thing that you already are in graduate school. A similar thing will be possible with this fear, but it may be a bit more difficult. A third thing to remember is that there are different things that you can do in life and that depends on what you want to do. If you want to face your fear but you don't know how, then you have a different problem entirely. The third thing you to think about is what are you so afraid of? You can't control everything, but you can control yourself and what you think about yourself. You can talk to your doctor about all the different ways that you can control yourself.You can't control everything, but you can control yourself and what you think about yourself. <|endoftext|>\n",

But there's this other guy who I haven't seen in years, and he's so distant. I don't know what to do. context: It may be helpful to have this conversation when you are feeling down or anxious. You can say something like \"I don't need to worry about how you are feeling right now. I think you are okay and I appreciate that you are concerned.\" Additionally, you may be wanting to talk about your anxiety as well.

Should I still be feeling like this? context: Thank you for your question. It's completely normal and natural to feel nervous before going into therapy. Many people report having felt this way. I can't say enough regarding the amount of courage it takes to reach out and attend a therapy session. For many people, it can take weeks, months, or even years of contemplating whether to see a therapist or not before actually contacting one and attending the first session. It takes courage to want to work through any struggles you may be having or personal growth you aspire toward. In your question, you mentioned that you've \"gone several times and are still feeling nervous and shaky.\" If you feel comfortable with your therapist and it's a good fit for you, I would suggest that it may be something to look into. It's not the therapist's job to make you feel comfortable with your therapist. It's good luck to you if you find a therapist who feels this way, and to make sure your anxiety isn't something you feel obligated to address until after the counselor is available to discuss it. <|endoftext|>\n",

This therapy thing your doing is sometimes scary. First, because your opening up things that you might have never wanted to. Second, your still building a relationship with this therapist person. You may never get over that. The therapist really can't be your \"friend\". They are there to push the buttons that you might not want pushed and help you heal.  That in itself is scary and can make you anxious. Third, you really never know where this therapy thing will go. Yes, there are goals. But sometimes side roads need to be taken and sometimes that is scary.Know this you are in the right place. You are taking steps to change. <|endoftext|>\n",
            "question: I've gone to a couple therapy sessions so far and still everytime I walk in I get nervous and shaky. Is this normal? Should I still be feeling like this? context: It’s probably really normal to feel nervous about going into therapy, it's just that a lot of people don't know how to really talk about their past or bring it up until a few sessions in order for us to discuss it but also stay civil and be professional if we feel like we have the right person to talk about past matters. I think you might be surprised how well it unfolds though. You aren't asking présistance because you haven't already checked in with your therapist about how you feel. Instead, you are looking for ways to enhance your present positive attributes by being present in your present relationship. Whether that is a book club, movie studio, relationship counseling, starting couples counseling, introducing yourself and your partner and sending him emails and text messages about your relationship progress and growth. Have an honest and open discussion with your therapist about how you feel? If you don't feel comfortable with your therapist, then it is time to re-evaluate your relationship and determine if you need to move on. <|endoftext|>\n",

You wrote that you want to fix your issues but never get around to it. I wonder how you are spending your mental and physical energy. Are you spending time taking care of and doing for others? I also wonder where the thoughts and feelings of being worthless are coming from - not just from being unloved. You may be experiencing a great deal of anxiety, and depression may affect this area particularly hard. Loneliness may affect your mood as low as once every three weeks. If you have a regular diet and exercise, this may be reflected in your mood and energy levels. Also, exercise level changes are very possible and not due to physical causes.

            " y'know, the good news is that people are starting to see that a little bit more clearly...that is, more than you realize and it's giving you a lot of room to grow.Lulling yourself with self-doubt is a great way to get at the root of it, the underlying fear is still underneath the surface fear, to gain some stability and acceptance.  I call this \"depression.\" It's a mood ailment.  Feelings like anger, shame, guilt, fear are not-so-good motivation.Depression is a mood ailment and it can manifest in many ways. I'd recommend that you focus on dreams, listen to your dreams, ask your partner what he or she does during these dreams, then you'll have a better chance of finding the motivation to stay in the relationship.If you sleep at night, panic attacks and  feeling like you are going crazy- just because you are not going to sleep at all does not mean that you are a bad person. Sleep is the big reset the body allows itself to feel.So, the important thing to remember is that you are not a bad person bc you are already bad. People listen to us for our opinions, but not even we can really answer those questions. We are just humans like you, we don't have those internal answers to our lives.If you are concerned that some of your negative thoughts may be from a traumatic experience, you might want to look at your own view of life. Do you see yourself as being happier, having more freedom, more freedom in your life? The answer is no. You have a myriad of choices and options in these matters. But the first question you have to ask yourself is \"What is the evidence that I am lovable?\" What evidence does he have that he is worthy of love? Is there any journal entries that he has that give you a glimpse of what he is like?
